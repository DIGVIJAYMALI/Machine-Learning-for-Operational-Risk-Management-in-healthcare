0,MED_1,"I cannot say enough good things about Intown PT. Ingrid is a magician. When I injured my shoulder, I thought I could fix it with no issues. I stretched, did sauna, cryo, reiki massage, sports massage, even energy healing. I went to Ingrid 2 hours ago and already feel 90% better. I don't understand how someone can be so good at their job."
1,MED_1,"After an urgent care visit for a pulled muscle in my neck, I called Intown PT. Muscle relaxers, pain meds - nothing was helping. Two dry needling sessions in, I was good as new. Almost miraculous, frankly. Highly recommend."
2,MED_1,"Both Ingrid and Jennifer are great. They used dry needling and other techniques to cure my back pain. I had gone to chiropractors and physical therapy for years with limited relief. But after a few sessions with them, my back stopped hurting for the first time in many years. I still have a sensitive back but nothing like before seeing them. One more thing, the receptionist, Katy is very efficient and easy to work with."
3,MED_1,Intown PT is fantastic! They helped me regain mobility in my hips that I thought was out of my reach. I highly recommend them to anyone who leads an active lifestyle.
4,MED_1,"OK, here's the deal: by looking at the red-cord contraption hanging from the ceiling, you'd think it was a S&M sex machine. (Not that I'd know - honest.) But after 2+ months of a disastrous lower back situation--to the point where I thought I was in traction--the *entire problem literally melted away. Ingrid Anderson is not only good at what she does--she's a phenomenally great person to talk to and confide in as well. Trustworthy, smart and dynamic. Bring your issues and she'll know how to fix them. She had surprising, drill-down knowledge of my male-centric issues and had a pointed empathy that really struck a cord (letter changed for the intended bad pun).In addition to all that, Ingrid gave me some great pointers on how to exercise in a smarter way that doesn't tax the body as hard as traditional stuff. It's a tack I'm going to take from now on to protect against injury in the future.So, if you're ailing about something, go. You'll leave there feeling better and smarter about your body. I promise."
5,MED_1,"I went to see Ingrid after having back and sciatic pain that would not go away. I was having trouble even getting in and out of my car. She performed a thorough intake and and was very interested in helping to find the right treatment for my issue. She did a needling technique I had never tried before - and the next day, the pain was gone! After one more follow up visit and some exercises to do at home, I'm doing much better. She is very kind and attentive and made me feel immediately at ease. Would highly recommend!!"
6,MED_1,Dr. Ingrid is an exceptional doctor. She used a technique known as dry-needling that totally healed my back. The office is in a great location and the entire staff is friendly. If you want a healing find Dr. E!
7,MED_1,"I was suffering from upper back pain between and around my shoulders that was causing me to pop Advil and Tylenol throughout the day like snacks and that was impacting my ability to concentrate. I saw Dr. Anderson and she did an amazing job treating me for the pain. By the time, I left that first visit my pain had dramatically improved, and it was completely gone by the time of our second visit a few days later. Dr. Anderson was very detail oriented, patiently soliciting the details of my pain and then providing me with information about what she believed was at the root of my troubles while suggesting how she was going to approach the therapy. She was very attentive, agreeable, and approachable and I felt well informed at every step of the treatment.I would recommend Dr. Anderson for anyone suffering from recurring muscular skeletal pains. I now know where to go should my neck or back trouble me again!"
8,MED_1,"Physical Therapy is a tricky one for me. I think I'm like most people when I say, all I want is fast results and very little homework. Dr. Anderson understood this all too well, and did a fantastic job at satisfying this while also providing me with some real pain relief. For years I have been avoiding doing activities that consistently result in pain, but it got to the point where there were few activities left I could do, and it was time to not only treat some acute pain I was suffering from a kickboxing injury, but to figure out the root problem. I've had 3 sessions and my acute pain is gone, and preventable in the future with the exercises I have (and I'm back at kickboxing!). With the underlying causes, we've been working together, and I've noticed I'm having considerably less day-to-day pain, which I had just got used to. Faith in PT is restored."
9,MED_1,"I came in to see Dr. Anderson for a wrist issue that is usually just a recurring annoyance and had transformed in to a full scale pain issue. I type a LOT for work, particularly leading up to the summer months, and my right wrist had gotten bad enough that I couldn't look at it without hurting! I went in and ten minutes later (only a few of them excruciating!) I was able to walk out feeling confident my hand wouldn't fall off. She gave me some really easy massage techniques I can do on my own while watching TV and voila! My husband has some outstanding back issues that he's just started seeing Dr. Anderson for and she's been wonderful. He tends to tense up when he thinks a ""pop"" is coming which makes traditional mobilization difficult. She's done some massage and small mobilizations on his spine and plans to use the red cord system to help him get back on track.What I love most about Dr. Anderson isn't that she gets results, it's that she really cares about her patients and is passionate about what she does. Whether I've seen her in office or out and about, she really tries to educate people on the way their bodies work and how to keep them healthy without being a total loon. She recognizes that people will always do things that are bad for them (playing nine straight hours of video games, working for 60 hours a week at the computer, wearing flip flops...) and tries to give her patients the tools they need to get through their bad habits without breaking themselves. She's personable and professional and her office staff (comprised of the amazing Amber) is flexible and helpful. Don't tell her this, but my clumsy ass is thankful for a PT nearby who will put up with me!"
10,MED_1,"I first visited Intown Physical Therapy to address a long-time shoulder issue exacerbated by a recent injury. Ingrid was extremely thorough in her review of my range of motion, pain points, strength issues, etc. and in a matter of weeks was able to get my shoulder not only functional again, but back in the gym with targeted exercised to rehab and restrengthen - and no surgery! Since then I've been back several times with different issues (knee, hip) and am experiencing the same results. Ingrid's deep and up-to-date knowledge of body mechanics combined with her awesome ""bedside manner"" has earned my trust. Her staff is great as well - very friendly, accommodating, and flexible; I've never had issues getting scheduled in short order. I highly recommend ITP!"
11,MED_1,"After reading all of Dr. Anderson's amazing reviews, I was very hopeful that she could help me. She was not covered by my insurance, but I really needed someone who would take the time to understand what was going on with my uncommon ailment.At my first appointment, I made it clear to Dr. Anderson that I was not really looking for treatment as I was waiting on surgery to correct my problem. I wanted suggestions for an exercise program I could do with my significant physical limitations until my surgery. She said she could provide that and also suggested a treatment option. I advised Dr. Anderson that I had little to no hope that her suggested treatment option would work because I had been doing years of similar treatments at other practices with zero improvement; however, since it wouldn't hurt anything to try and I was already there, I agreed to it. After approximately four appointments (and $400 later), I had no improvement in my pain and Dr. Anderson had shown me one exercise that could work for me. At the last appointment I had with her, she said she would write up a program and email it to me.I never heard from her again. I tried calling her office a dozen or so times during regular business hours. Sometimes I received the answering service but several times I was able to get through to the receptionist. The receptionist let me know the office didn't get the messages I left with the answering service. The last time I was able to reach the receptionist, I explained that I had not received the exercises Dr. Anderson had promised and would like to speak with Dr. Anderson. I emphasized that Dr. Anderson was not returning my messages. The receptionist told me he would personally make sure Dr. Anderson called me back as soon as she walked in the door. I did not hear from the office again. I tried many times after that to reach the office but my phone calls were not answered.I feel very disappointed with my experience at this office. I do not feel that I would recommend this provider to anyone."
12,MED_1,I've been working with Jennifer at IPT for a couple of months now. I had a rotator cuff injury in November 2015 and she's helped me enormously in dealing with the pain and providing exercises to help with healing. She's just wonderful - she's strong but gentle as needed and fully explains what she's doing and why. She asks questions and educates you as she's working with you.
13,MED_1,"I could not imagine a better experience with a physical therapist- I walked into Dr. Anderson's office barely able to walk after an accident at work that left me in agonizing lower back pain. I needed for someone to pull out all the stops, since I have a very active job that requires me to be on my feet constantly, and that she did. IN ABUNDANCE. She was incredibly gentle, and what I thought was back pain that would put me out of commission for weeks (or more!) was resolved in two days. Seriously, I hobbled pathetically into her office on a Wednesday, went to work on Thursday, went back for a brief follow-up and was dancing by Friday!"
14,MED_1,"Dr. Anderson is an outstanding physical therapist. She quickly assessed my problem and had me back on my feet ( or using my knee, to be exact) in no time. Her office is pleasant, friendly and has easy access. Her wealth of knowledge and understanding of the body is clear to see.If you are hurting, go to see her!"
15,MED_1,"I have been receiving therapy for postpartum back and hip pain. So far, I have been very impressed. The young woman who signed me in was courteous and knowledgeable. I found immediate relief from my hip pan after our appointment, and was given exercises to work on improving my abdominal tone to help with the back pain. Dr. Anderson was professional without being stuffy. I felt as though I was in very good hands. I am going back for follow-up treatment in the coming weeks!"
16,MED_1,"Dr. Anderson takes a unique approach with patient care. In the interest of full disclosure, I am a PT myself, albeit not in the same setting, so I am skeptical and always ask questions. She took my suggestions and ideas seriously and I felt involved in the decision making process. She was interested in hearing what I felt the problem was as what it was preventing me from doing. In my case, I had goals to participate in several road races that my injury was preventing. From there, she didn't just say, ""Do these exercises."" Instead, she designed a treatment plan that involved clinic time that just wasn't repeating my home program. Add to that, I had a do-able home exercise program. After several sessions at Intown PT, I was able to attain my first goal by competing in my 10K race. With no pain and greatly improved strength, I am now preparing for my next race this fall. Thank you!!"
17,MED_2,"These therapists are a class act!Everyone there is helpful, friendly and attentive. I have been working with Ali Hoegel for months. She has addressed my needs and then some!I love these guys!!!!!"
18,MED_2,"The first physical therapy business that I ever felt like worked do improve my movement. Rather than showing up doing lame exercises .i could do on my own at home, they worked me out and pushed me to get better range of motion and gave me homework to do the easy exercises on my own. They used my appointment time productively.. always courteous and professional, would definitely recommend them!"
19,MED_2,"I can't over exaggerate, this place has amazing customer service. Every staff member I have interacted with these past few weeks has been top notch. Kai (who I'm seeing for my knee) is extremely knowledgeable and friendly. I actually look forward to my appointments. I saw a difference from the first visit on. Go to them!"
20,MED_3,My girlfriend was dealing with a debilitating headache and was having trouble getting out of bed and was in desperate need of an adjustment... on a Friday afternoon. We called many other places in Buckhead but none could help us. Except Empower and Benjamin Karpus. He worked with us to set a time that was good for both parties and he showed up right on time. Dr. Karpus was an absolute life saver and we will be going to Empower from now on. Highly reccomend.
21,MED_3,"A few weeks ago, I woke up feeling extremely stiff. I could barely turn my head as my back and neck were impacted by the way I slept the previous night. The next day, I went to my traditional chiropractor and got an adjustment which did not change my symptoms. I was concerned that I would not heal from the pain. One night the pain was so excruciating it woke me up at 2:30 in the morning. I grabbed my phone and started searching Yelp for the highest rated chiropractors in Atlanta. I came across Dr. Karpus's information and scheduled an appointment for his next available opening. His technique is impeccable and proved to be very beneficial to me. Thank you Dr. Karpus and thank you Yelp! I feel so much better."
22,MED_3,"Listen here, Joey's firm pressure is not for the weak lol i knew my shoulders & neck needed a lot of attention. Knots and kinks everywhere. I'm sore now but i can tell he helped me out and i will feel A L O T better tomorrow. I will definitely be back !"
23,MED_3,"I am so lucky to have found Dr. Benny Karpus! I really appreciate someone who understands what they're doing and why. I came in with some gnarly shoulder pain that radiated down my arm. Dr. Benny gave me an adjustment with some new (to me) chiropractic techniques and had me feeling aligned and better. He then did some dry needling (which didn't hurt at all and was pretty cool), and finished it off with a Thai-derived massage. All his techniques were customized because he actually understands what he's doing. It was a neat experience and, most importantly, I feel much better! Thank you, Dr. Benny!Pro tip: Their office is in the building in the Yelp pictures. Park outside, go in (two doors), and down to the first floor. You'll see the doors numbered and should be able to find it pretty easily. Enjoy!"
24,MED_3,"Not to be dramatic, but Mr. Karpus is a life saver. He's wonderful.I am a hairstylist with 9 years in the business, often working 11 hour days for my own company. I went through a period in my life where my hands and wrists were wildly inflamed and I lived with a chronic pain in both hands 24/7. It hurt to drive home at night, and even to twist doorknobs. And my hands were CONSTANTLY falling asleep as I slept. I saw a chiro for about a year with no results. I invested a lot of money and went regularly every 5 weeks with no progress and left feeling more defeated.My boyfriend surprised me with a visit to Benny earlier this year and I immediately felt renewed. He is beyond knowledgeable and makes it a point to tailor specifically to your needs. He used a combination of methods for my muscles and realigned my C4, C5, and C6 disks that were compressed. And pardon my French, but I appreciate that he doesn't try to set you up on a bullshit 5-week program. His interest is 120% with his customer, and not a program. If you're tired of chronic pain, I can't recommend Benny enough!! It has truly impacted me and allowed me to keep pursuing my passion as a hairstylist and you can't put a price on that. So thankful!"
25,MED_3,"If you are struggling with any sort of neck/back pain (aren't we all) this is the place to go!! I have been to countless physical therapists, chiropractors, trainers, doctors you name it for my neck issues and Benny trumps them all. I have had shooting pain in my left shoulder/neck area so bad it was making my arm numb. Benny takes the time to listen to exactly what you need and uses his unique expertise to pinpoint the root of the pain and will manipulate your body back to where it should be. He is so well educated and experienced using techniques from Eastern medicine. He offers dry needling and Thai massages that are a game changer. He solves the mysteries that other doctors can't figure out and will make sure to get to the bottom of whatever is giving you pain. Trust me, do not go to a chiropractor to just get aligned only told to come back every week. Empower Rehab is on a league of its own. it has changed my body and given me relief I have never felt before. I know that If I am ever feeling off he will make sure to get my in as soon as possible."
26,MED_3,"Dr. K is a true healer. In a world with PT clinic franchises that are popping up everywhere there's a Starbucks and providers coming and going like a revolving door, it's comforting to see someone that's actually giving real patient care! Dr. K actually ""fixes"" people! That's all you need to know! Well...that and his address."
27,MED_3,I've been meaning to write this for a hot minute. I came here because I woke up one day and I legit couldn't turn my head more that 3 inches to the right or left. I thought it would go away and it definitely didn't. So I come here and we go straight into it. I'm one of those people that wants to be cracked like a GLOW STICK and man he did just that. I felt every vertebrae in me just rejoicing. He had his foot in my shoulder to get this stubborn one out. And I'm telling you. The next morning I legit felt like I was reborn. And he specializes in Thai techniques which is great for me because I am an Asian woman and I have hyper mobility in almost all my joints and pain points. I legit haven't had to go back because he set me up. THANK YOU
28,MED_3,"The Doctor is in the House!! Benny is the ultimate professional. I found him on yelp while doing some traveling in Atlanta for work. Benny was accommodating and went out of his way to take care of me. I wanted just the dry needling service but he did everything. Adjustment, alignment of hips and overall he just cared.Here's how it went down: Landed Saturday from Orange County Ca at 345, special appt time at 5, meeting Sunday from 730-1 on plane back to Orange County Ca by 145pm Sunday. I will travel miles again to see Benny. If you have any issues anywhere in your body see Benny while he's got appt time available. He barely got me in that day. Keep up the good work Benny. :)"
29,MED_3,"You know when you're mid rep of a strenuous, heavy-weight exercise and some idiot comes to talk to you? The moment I turned my head to address that idiot was the last moment my neck felt normal for a month. That is, until Dr. Magic Fingers Karpus got his digits in there. After about half an hour with Benny, I was better than ever. If you have any kind of lingering sports injury, chronic pain, or idiot-induced pulled muscle, don't waste any more time and call Benny."
30,MED_3,"Benny is amazing. He went above and beyond to make sure I didn't just leave with a temporary solution for my back. He found a way to fix an issue with my neck that was causing numbness in my shoulder that I have had since high school. He takes a logical approach to assessing and reassessing the issues he sees, not only fixing what he can while you are with him, but giving you a way forward to make sure the work was not done in vain. His knowledge is outstanding, from having an eye for misalignments but also in the physical therapy side, doing dry needling, and recommending stretches and exercises to straighten my body out. I would absolutely recommend him."
31,MED_3,"Dr. Karpus is awesome! He has helped me fully recover from an impinged shoulder injury, and also has been working with me to erase my lingering neck pain from a serious car crash. Empower is NOT a place where you'll be strung along or given unnecessary treatments in order to generate revenue. Dr. Karpus will listen to what's ailing you, ask you the important questions, and then tell you everything that he's going to do any the ""why"" behind all of the work so you are comfortable with the therapy and know that your issues have been heard.  This place works on the idea that if they can fully heal you, you'll spread the word to others, and I think this is an obvious difference between them and most companies that want repeat customers. I'd recommend Empower to anyone in need of physical therapy. Top notch treatment."
32,MED_3,After recently moving to the city I lived and slept without a mattress for a week and a half. On a blanket. On hard wood. By day four I was waking up with so much back pain it hurt to breathe! Dr. Karpus popped and prodded me in all the right places and taught me a thing or two about keeping my spine aligned and in fine condition. Only chiropractor that will actually treat your pain first visit and not keep insisting for follow ups! Highly recommend
33,MED_3,"I had never tried physical therapy before but with hip pain becoming increasingly painful, I knew I had to try something. I called and they were able to see me same day (which is a huge relief when you're in pain). I didn't know what to expect but Dr Karpus was very patient in explaining everything to me. He started out minimally and progressed with my feedback. You could tell that he was genuinely concerned and not just looking for a paycheck. With the Yelp deal it was a very affordable session and I will be back for any future needs!"
34,MED_3,"Dr. Karpus' approach is amazing! I've suffered from intense pain in my neck & upper back with associated headaches for months. I'm only two 60 minute sessions in and have near complete pain relief in my neck and spine -- something that months of deep tissue massages, standard PT appointments, and OTC pain meds have not been able to touch. I highly recommend him to anyone who wants to feel better & fast!"
35,MED_3,"Dr. Karpus got me back to feeling like a million bucks! We did everything! Thai massage, dry needling , stretching and more! 5 stars all the way"
36,MED_3,"Had a great experience with Dr. Karpus! More comprehensive than any Chiro I've been to, and I feel much better after only one treatment. I will definitely be coming back to keep everything aligned and to help keep me loose."
37,MED_3,"Dr. Karpus is great. I called him due to a hand pain and he was able to fit me in right away. He evaluated what was going on and was honest in saying I needed to keep my hand still and gave me a brace. Because he did not end up having to manipulate the hand, he did not charge me. What a wonderful professional - i felt really taken care of, and really appreciated his service-oriented, genuine manner. My hand is doing great. Thank you Dr. Karpus!"
38,MED_4,The people who work at Benchmark are amazing. They're very skilled and knowledgeable. I'm currently going to Benchmark Physical Therapy for 2 separate issues - hamstring & shoulder and I can't believe the progress I've made on both.Thank you to all of the amazing people at Benchmark who made this progress possible. I would definitely recommend Benchmark to anyone considering physical therapy.
39,MED_4,Erin is basically my hero. I have been seeing her for the past few years due to some chronic arthritis and ligament issues I have to manage and she has done so much for my quality of life. She is a great person and GREAT doctor who cares about your health and understands how mentally and physically challenging managing chronic pain can be. Seeing Erin is one of the best health decisions I have ever made and I recommend her without reservation. THANK YOU BENCHMARK BUCKHEAD!!
40,MED_4,"I cannot say enough great things about this physical therapy office. It really does feel like a family. Jessica at the front desk is always positive and knows my voice on the phone. She knows how to bring a smile to my face even if I had a bad day before coming in. Erin is my physical therapist and she knows how to help my shoulder get to where it needs to be. She is very encouraging and helps modify exercises so I'm not in unnecessary pain. She also always helps to accommodate if something comes up in my schedule. When she had to be out for a couple of weeks, physical therapists from different locations cane to help. I was so impressed because they were also wonderful! That was amazing because I didn't have to worry even though my regular therapist was out. Stephanie at the same location is also so nice but she is not my therapist. Her patients really seem to love her. I am very happy with my decision to come here and when I had surgery it was no question that I would come here for my post surgery therapy. Love them!"
41,MED_4,"I love Benchmark! Everyone here is fantastic and I can't say enough about Dr. Stephanie and how much she has changed my life! My muscle spasms are finally getting under control with her dry needling technique! I would refer anyone I know with any kind of head, jaw, neck, shoulder, and back pain to go see her!"
42,MED_4,Jessica is the best front offfice you could ask for. She anticipates my needs and knows how to encourage me to not give up on any given exercise. She is the best!
43,MED_4,"I've had some issues with Benchmark that I need to put in a review. I've been promised a phone call about these issues 8 days ago that has yet to happen. I had some visits (2 that I'm aware of at this point) denied by my insurance. I called Benchmark on 8/16 and spoke with someone. I'm not going to name names. She promised that someone would call me the next day and would check with my insurance company to see what the issue was to be sure. I'm still waiting for that phone call. They've just ghosted me. Not cool, Benchmark. I mean really? You can't even see what the issue is and let me know as I requested? I'm really frustrated with the whole process. I don't get an insurance book from my company that informs me of # of visits per year or copays. Nor was I informed of this by Benchmark. Yet I hear them tell other patients that they have only one more visit left. I can only surmise that I must somehow be ""different"", and not in a good way. And that is not sitting well with me as I write this review. I've been other places for PT and never felt like I was put on the ""back burner"" until now. I think it's an inexcusable way to run a business personally."
44,MED_4,"Dr. Megan is absolutely the BEST!! I love coming to this Benchmark. Asia who runs the front desk is professional, courteous and helpful. Even though this location is right on Peachtree, they have easy parking and great hours if you're worried about fighting traffic.If you need PT, the light, fun environment provided here helps recovery go quickly!"
45,MED_5,"I've gone here many times over the last ten years for several post-injury rehabs. They are truly spectacular. Chris Olson specifically is amazing, but they whole staff is knowledgeable and helpful.Chris helped me immensely after I tore ligaments in my ankle, and miraculously, I'm back on the soccer field! She was also instrumental in rehabbing after shoulder surgeries. My range of motion is like it was pre-surgery! Far better than I could have ever hoped.I can honestly say, they're the only good part of getting injured!"
46,MED_5,"I had been going to physical therapy here once a week for few months back in the spring, and recently had to back for hamstring pull (related to my weak hips which is why I was there in the first place). I was mainly treated by Chris Olson. She is fantastic! Has a great sense of humor and pushes you -- but be prepared to work hard and probably end up in some discomfort. Or straight out pain if she decides to dry needle you. Don't worry -- they have two stuffed animals to keep you company while you sit through it. And after a day of dealing with the soreness you'll feel better. All the staff are very friendly, easy-going, and generally attentive. It has a great vibe -- everyone seems like they get along and enjoy working together. I never had any issues with billing or scheduling an appointment. They do try some non-traditional more Eastern medicine things, like dry needling and cupping, but I found for me it helped a lot. Hopefully my physical ailments are behind me, but if I ever have another I'll definitely be coming back."
47,MED_5,"Chris Olson and her team at the midtown office of Sports Rehab Center helped me several times over the years to recover from injuries sustained during NCAA lacrosse officiating. I appreciated her expertise in working with older athletes, like me, to return to the field as quickly as possible. Her great sense of humor helped me to get through some of the tougher, but necessary, aspects of rehab. I highly recommend."
48,MED_5,My daughter has been receiving treatment at The Dunwoody JCC branch from Amy Wolkin and we are very satisfied with her progress and results. Amy is very professional and knowledgable.
49,MED_5,"I enjoyed going here. The environment is very comfortable; but they are not very Time-efficient. While doing therapy exercises, they won't tell me what to do next until its time to move on, and I'll have the wait 30 seconds after each set for the student to come back and tell me what to do. It really adds to the time for a session. One session took 2hrs from arrival to leaving.They misquoted me when I first went and it took 8 sessions for their to spot their error. I choose this place because they were cheaper when i shopped around, so I was a bit frustrated with this error. I could have been going to my Orthopedists own rehab for the same rate.Having said all that, I did like my physical therapist Tiffany Davenport, and its much easier to park here and walk in than to park($) and go up the Emory Midtown medical tower where my Dr's rehab location is. And sometimes there were cupcakes around during physio."
50,MED_5,"So, I've had brain surgery & 2 major spinal surgeries. I have metal running from my skull all the way down my neck, which is about 75% metal. When I finished my surgeries in NY, they sent me home with instructions to go to PT. I was frantic, because my first thought was, ""there's no way anyone is TOUCHING this.""My GP recommended them, & I trust her completely. (Pride Medical, see my other reviews.) I went in wearily, but was seen by the owner, Brian, who has 6 or 7 titles following his name. He gained my trust instantly. I went here for 4 months 3x a week, & now have returned going 2x a week for 6 more months. I never dread going, because I always come out feeling better. I see both Brian & Barb, who both are true experts at what they do. They familiarized themselves with my conditions, & not once have either worked on me in a way that was wrong (if you've ever had PT you know what I mean when I say it just feels *wrong*.)If they can take care of me, I'd venture to say they can take care of anyone. I absolutely love them, & would never consider going elsewhere.Oh, & another plus - they are extremely easy to work with when it comes to insurance. Can't beat that."
51,MED_5,Excellent rehab. Chris Olson & staff push you to work past your limits. When I walk again it will be due in no small part to their efforts.
52,MED_5,"I found them on Google, read the reviews and decided to give them a try, I have been to many physical therapy places over the years from FL, DC to MD and now ATL, so I'm really picky and don't have time for therapy places that treat me like a $ sign. I had a total knee replacement. This was my 9th surgery on this damn knee. I left an Internet question on their site. They promptly replied which was the first good sighn. I was treated as if I was the only person in there, when clearly we know they can treat up to 3 patients at a time. Chris was my therapist, she was extremely professional yet casuals casual enough to cuss when expressing some things that were graphic. She evaluated me then, gave me a very challenging session. I am very blessed to have found them. Now Because I don't watch sports I really couldn't identify with the numerous thank you autograph face shots that were up. But they were nice to see. Overall great place, you will defefenly see great results by going. I highly recommend them."
53,MED_5,"I went to the Sports Rehabilitation Center after having sport's hernia surgery. Previous to this I had two stints in physical therapy Pre-surgery. They provided the best experience out of the three clinics. They didn't rush me out of a session after a half hour like the other clinics, instead I continued to perform the exercises under the guidance of an assistant and it didn't matter if it took an hour+. I also liked that they took the time to listen to you and and modified exercises if you we're having an issue."
54,MED_6,"I found Inspire Health through ClassPass and took a reformer pilates class here with a friend. I was impressed with how friendly and welcoming all staff were. The studio is clean and very pretty. The reformer class was fantastic, and our instructor Missy was so incredibly helpful. She corrected our form when needed, and gave us individual attention, which was so refreshing, compared to other pilates classes I have taken. We did a full body workout, and I was definitely sore the day after. Inspire also offers physical therapy, yoga and massage, and I was impressed with all of the equipment I saw.I would highly recommend this studio and can't wait to take another pilates class here!"
55,MED_6,"I came to one of their group classes on the Reformer machine. I had never seen this class available before, but it could have been because they only have 6 machines, so their classes remain small. Their studio is open, bright, and clean. Their instructors were super helpful, friendly, and attentive. There were many times where she would give me personalized instruction if I was doing something different/wrong from the group. They offered many different ways to modify a move if something didn't feel right. There were some people in the room doing physical therapy, which I could see may have been awkward for them, a group of 6 people coming in for a workout class while you are at therapy... but they didn't seem to mind. It was definitely a good workout, even though it didn't seem too difficult at the time (didn't sweat much, but was sore the next couple days)"
56,MED_6,"Inspire has the best PT and Pilates I've ever had (and I've been to a few places). I take privates with a PT who also knows Pilates, so she knows how to switch from Stott Pilates to PT in an instant. We take care of any tightness before doing Pilates, so I don't injure myself working out. It's been a life changer! It's not a convenient location for me but it's worth it."
57,MED_6,This was my first visit to Inspire Health. I thought the instructor was great - fun and super helpful. I had never done a Reformer class before and loved it! I have already signed up for my next lesson.
58,MED_6,"This is a spacious and fully-equipped Pilates and physical therapy studio. All of the equipment seems new and well-maintained. The front desk and staff are friendly, and the instructor was able to give me accomodations when needed for a few exercises. I will be back."
59,MED_7,"I've been to others physical therapy providers and none come close to the personal attention provided by Motion Stability. I have been working with Deanna Camillo through a knee and now a hip replacement. Her personal and caring approach to my well being is terrific. She is knowledgeable, professional and most importantly cares about her patients. Brian has put together a great team; I highly recommend them."
60,MED_7,"I can't recommend Motion Stability PT more. After injuring my neck, I went to the PT my orthopedist referred me to inside a major hospital system. It was crazy busy and I got three minutes of the therapist's time and didn't feel like he really knew what was going on with me. I asked a PT friend for a recommendation, and she told me to definitely try Motion Stability. I am so glad I did. It's covered by my insurance and my copay is the same as the first PT clinic I tried, but so much better. I get one-on-one time with my therapist, Jacob Stagnaro, and he's involved his colleagues in my case so we can really figure out the issue and have as many resources as possible. When an expert doesn't let his ego get in the way of helping a patient, that's how you know you've found the right one. I completely trust him and feel heard and respected. There's no need to go to a PT clinic that feels like a factory - for the same price, you can get 40 minutes of personal attention and conscientious care at Motion Stability. Thanks to Jacob and the rest of the staff there, I finally feel like I'm in good hands and will be able to live pain-free soon."
61,MED_7,"With many physical issues from arthritis, lower back pain, hip bursitis, IT band issues etc. I thought that my referral to Motion Stability was going to be the same type of PT. Boy, was I wrong!!! After 5 sessions with Dhara and Brian I can say this without reservation that my pain level and mobility has improved. I know that I have a lot of work and sessions ahead of me but I would highly recommend this practice to anyone with issues and don't wait in hopes that the pain will get better without PT assistance. Take it from a hard headed person that thought this would be another ""bandaid"" fix but I could not have been more wrong. Get a medical referral or just give yourself a gift and GO!!! Thanks to all of you that take care of us."
62,MED_7,I have been to several PT groups over the years. Many spent too much time just watching me exercise. That is not the case at Motion Stability. The care I get from Deanna Camillo is excellent.  I will never again go for PT anywhere else.
63,MED_7,"After dealing with back issues for the past 9 years, and going to 3 different Physical Therapists that I didn't really click with, I am SO glad I found Deanna. Seriously, I cannot say enough good things about her.Phsyical Therapy isn't just phsyical, it's also mental, and Deanna helped me to get past the mental 'downness' (I realize that's not a real word) that I developed as a result of my condition. I'd always known I had a bad back, but now it has a name and it was as pretty scary sounding name. Deanna took the time to get to know me, but also push me past things when I thought they'd be too hard or I was scared. Obviously without actually giving me things that ARE too hard.I always came away from PT in a better mood than I came in, and that's saying a lot. I've now graduated to coming in only once a month, and that's a good thing! PT is intended to help you get better, not just ongoing therapy forever and ever. In all the times I've been to therapists I've never really graduated officially, I've just 'timed out' as my previous insurance only paid for limited amounts.Thanks Deanna for being your awesome self! And the rest of the team there is great too - Darcy is always so kind and welcoming at the front desk, even when I was kinda spacy on pain killers the first few times I came in!"
64,MED_7,"Called them on Monday to schedule an appt, and was asked if she could call me back, as she was slammed. No one ever called me back. I called in again the next day. She scheduled me for an appt a couple days later. She emailed me paperwork and confirmed the time and day I had already wrote down. I arrived to the appt only for them to realize, I was actually scheduled next Thur. They were trying to contact another therapist to come in, but 25 min after appt should have started, I'm leaving not having seen anyone. Such a disappointment, but I should have picked up on the disorganization from the first call I had made originally."
65,MED_7,I've found Brian to be a fantastic physical therapist in the Atlanta area and would highly recommend him and his team at Motion Stability.
66,MED_7,"As a Physical Therapist myself who recently moved back to the Atlanta area, I can highly recommend this clinic. It is a top notch clinic with very intelligent and skilled therapists. After a few issues of my own, I saw Dr. Adrianna Nebedum who at first visit asked very relevant questions and performed proper tests without wasting any time before beginning treatment. I was initially seeing her for a post op shoulder surgery which she did an excellent job treating. What I was pleasantly surprised with was getting Dry Needled in the neck/shoulder area as well as the hips. For those who don't know, the simple explanation for dry needling is that it uses acupuncture needles to go for those pesky trigger points, spasms, or knots that your average massage can't get. I was skeptical at first but I can vouch that it works wonders for certain conditions such as sciatica, low back/neck pain... I'm not going to lie, it might be slightly painful at first but the juice is definitely worth the squeeze as you will likely feel a huge difference afterwards depending on your injury. This clinic has your best interest in mind as it emphasis quality care typically in a one on one session with quality Physical Therapist making sure all of your needs are addressed. Sadly, most clinics aren't run like this today as you typically have to share your time with multiple patients during the same hour with potentially less qualified professionals often compromising your care. If you are looking for an in-network clinic that gets results without padding your time with hot/cold packs that you could do at home yourself, do yourself a favor and book a session soon!"
67,MED_7,I have not experienced a physical therapy office like Motion Stability! Brian was incredibly knowledgeable and kind when talking about my injuries. The facilities are spacious and clean. I can't wait to continue my treatments here.
68,MED_8,"Warning: They are owned by Wellstar Hospital and appointments are billed as such, so your insurance will evaluate the claim as a hospital visit. In my situation this resulted in having to pay $75 to $225 per visit instead of a $50 copay each time. They have no problem encouraging a greater number of appointments because ""you'll meet your deductible sooner rather than later"". Other than that issue, I think PT Solutions is a good provider. Staff was friendly and you get a good amount of attention despite them juggling multiple patients at a time. That being said, if you want undivided attention I would not recommend going here unless you only make appointments during the slower hours. Office was very nice with a lot of great equipment. I do feel they helped with my neck issues but I will not be returning due to their billing practices."
69,MED_9,"Collin is a superlative carer and knowledgeable PT. By every criteria I can think of, his service was 10/10."
70,MED_9,"I found Collin by doing a Google search. I'm really happy I did. He is a smart and caring Physical Therapist who always gives you his undivided attention. I appreciate the one-on-one treatment that isn't always the same. What impressed me most is something called dry needling. For me it works better than acupuncture or massage I have had in the past. I think it is because it is more specific . Also, the space is never busy or ""full of patients""."
71,MED_9,"After having a less than ideal experience elsewhere, we brought our toddler to work with Erin. We had a wonderful experience and highly recommend Erin for pediatric physical therapy. Our daughter had slightly low muscle tone and was slow to transition into her gross motor skill milestones like crawling and walking. Erin specifically helped our daughter transition through these stages and provided us with the standardized assessments. Not only is Erin wonderful and friendly, but we really enjoyed the extra clean facilities. Take your kids here!"
72,MED_9,"I called OnePoint for an appointment and got voicemail. Colin and his wife returned my call in a matter of hours and set up an appointment for three days later. I had my appointment yesterday with Colin; zero waiting and a lovely facility in a residential community. I felt that I had his undivided attention for the duration of my visit, and Colin's got the perfect mix of expertise and passion for physical therapy and biomechanics. I'm a highly active person, so I'm thrilled to add OnePoint to my roster of professionals who help me stay in my best shape. Very glad to have OnePoint nearby."
73,MED_10,"I've gone here many times over the last ten years for several post-injury rehabs. They are truly spectacular. Chris Olson specifically is amazing, but they whole staff is knowledgeable and helpful.Chris helped me immensely after I tore ligaments in my ankle, and miraculously, I'm back on the soccer field! She was also instrumental in rehabbing after shoulder surgeries. My range of motion is like it was pre-surgery! Far better than I could have ever hoped.I can honestly say, they're the only good part of getting injured!"
74,MED_10,"I had been going to physical therapy here once a week for few months back in the spring, and recently had to back for hamstring pull (related to my weak hips which is why I was there in the first place). I was mainly treated by Chris Olson. She is fantastic! Has a great sense of humor and pushes you -- but be prepared to work hard and probably end up in some discomfort. Or straight out pain if she decides to dry needle you. Don't worry -- they have two stuffed animals to keep you company while you sit through it. And after a day of dealing with the soreness you'll feel better. All the staff are very friendly, easy-going, and generally attentive. It has a great vibe -- everyone seems like they get along and enjoy working together. I never had any issues with billing or scheduling an appointment. They do try some non-traditional more Eastern medicine things, like dry needling and cupping, but I found for me it helped a lot. Hopefully my physical ailments are behind me, but if I ever have another I'll definitely be coming back."
75,MED_10,"Chris Olson and her team at the midtown office of Sports Rehab Center helped me several times over the years to recover from injuries sustained during NCAA lacrosse officiating. I appreciated her expertise in working with older athletes, like me, to return to the field as quickly as possible. Her great sense of humor helped me to get through some of the tougher, but necessary, aspects of rehab. I highly recommend."
76,MED_10,My daughter has been receiving treatment at The Dunwoody JCC branch from Amy Wolkin and we are very satisfied with her progress and results. Amy is very professional and knowledgable.
77,MED_10,"I enjoyed going here. The environment is very comfortable; but they are not very Time-efficient. While doing therapy exercises, they won't tell me what to do next until its time to move on, and I'll have the wait 30 seconds after each set for the student to come back and tell me what to do. It really adds to the time for a session. One session took 2hrs from arrival to leaving.They misquoted me when I first went and it took 8 sessions for their to spot their error. I choose this place because they were cheaper when i shopped around, so I was a bit frustrated with this error. I could have been going to my Orthopedists own rehab for the same rate.Having said all that, I did like my physical therapist Tiffany Davenport, and its much easier to park here and walk in than to park($) and go up the Emory Midtown medical tower where my Dr's rehab location is. And sometimes there were cupcakes around during physio."
78,MED_10,"So, I've had brain surgery & 2 major spinal surgeries. I have metal running from my skull all the way down my neck, which is about 75% metal. When I finished my surgeries in NY, they sent me home with instructions to go to PT. I was frantic, because my first thought was, ""there's no way anyone is TOUCHING this.""My GP recommended them, & I trust her completely. (Pride Medical, see my other reviews.) I went in wearily, but was seen by the owner, Brian, who has 6 or 7 titles following his name. He gained my trust instantly. I went here for 4 months 3x a week, & now have returned going 2x a week for 6 more months. I never dread going, because I always come out feeling better. I see both Brian & Barb, who both are true experts at what they do. They familiarized themselves with my conditions, & not once have either worked on me in a way that was wrong (if you've ever had PT you know what I mean when I say it just feels *wrong*.)If they can take care of me, I'd venture to say they can take care of anyone. I absolutely love them, & would never consider going elsewhere.Oh, & another plus - they are extremely easy to work with when it comes to insurance. Can't beat that."
79,MED_10,Excellent rehab. Chris Olson & staff push you to work past your limits. When I walk again it will be due in no small part to their efforts.
80,MED_10,"I found them on Google, read the reviews and decided to give them a try, I have been to many physical therapy places over the years from FL, DC to MD and now ATL, so I'm really picky and don't have time for therapy places that treat me like a $ sign. I had a total knee replacement. This was my 9th surgery on this damn knee. I left an Internet question on their site. They promptly replied which was the first good sighn. I was treated as if I was the only person in there, when clearly we know they can treat up to 3 patients at a time. Chris was my therapist, she was extremely professional yet casuals casual enough to cuss when expressing some things that were graphic. She evaluated me then, gave me a very challenging session. I am very blessed to have found them. Now Because I don't watch sports I really couldn't identify with the numerous thank you autograph face shots that were up. But they were nice to see. Overall great place, you will defefenly see great results by going. I highly recommend them."
81,MED_10,"I went to the Sports Rehabilitation Center after having sport's hernia surgery. Previous to this I had two stints in physical therapy Pre-surgery. They provided the best experience out of the three clinics. They didn't rush me out of a session after a half hour like the other clinics, instead I continued to perform the exercises under the guidance of an assistant and it didn't matter if it took an hour+. I also liked that they took the time to listen to you and and modified exercises if you we're having an issue."
82,MED_11,Awesome place to go go for physical therapy. They are very professional and very friendly. They make you feel very comfortable. Thank you all.
83,MED_11,I have been here as patient and referred several friends. They are AWESOME and really care for their clients. They truly treat you like family. It is both a casual and professional environment where you feel comfortable with the staff working with you. I mean physical therapy can be very awkward with the hands on treatment but they know how to make you feel comfortable. They have some cool new treatments too so be sure to ask about their laser therapy :)
84,MED_12,The people who work at Benchmark are amazing. They're very skilled and knowledgeable. I'm currently going to Benchmark Physical Therapy for 2 separate issues - hamstring & shoulder and I can't believe the progress I've made on both.Thank you to all of the amazing people at Benchmark who made this progress possible. I would definitely recommend Benchmark to anyone considering physical therapy.
85,MED_12,Erin is basically my hero. I have been seeing her for the past few years due to some chronic arthritis and ligament issues I have to manage and she has done so much for my quality of life. She is a great person and GREAT doctor who cares about your health and understands how mentally and physically challenging managing chronic pain can be. Seeing Erin is one of the best health decisions I have ever made and I recommend her without reservation. THANK YOU BENCHMARK BUCKHEAD!!
86,MED_12,"I cannot say enough great things about this physical therapy office. It really does feel like a family. Jessica at the front desk is always positive and knows my voice on the phone. She knows how to bring a smile to my face even if I had a bad day before coming in. Erin is my physical therapist and she knows how to help my shoulder get to where it needs to be. She is very encouraging and helps modify exercises so I'm not in unnecessary pain. She also always helps to accommodate if something comes up in my schedule. When she had to be out for a couple of weeks, physical therapists from different locations cane to help. I was so impressed because they were also wonderful! That was amazing because I didn't have to worry even though my regular therapist was out. Stephanie at the same location is also so nice but she is not my therapist. Her patients really seem to love her. I am very happy with my decision to come here and when I had surgery it was no question that I would come here for my post surgery therapy. Love them!"
87,MED_12,"I love Benchmark! Everyone here is fantastic and I can't say enough about Dr. Stephanie and how much she has changed my life! My muscle spasms are finally getting under control with her dry needling technique! I would refer anyone I know with any kind of head, jaw, neck, shoulder, and back pain to go see her!"
88,MED_12,Jessica is the best front offfice you could ask for. She anticipates my needs and knows how to encourage me to not give up on any given exercise. She is the best!
89,MED_12,"I've had some issues with Benchmark that I need to put in a review. I've been promised a phone call about these issues 8 days ago that has yet to happen. I had some visits (2 that I'm aware of at this point) denied by my insurance. I called Benchmark on 8/16 and spoke with someone. I'm not going to name names. She promised that someone would call me the next day and would check with my insurance company to see what the issue was to be sure. I'm still waiting for that phone call. They've just ghosted me. Not cool, Benchmark. I mean really? You can't even see what the issue is and let me know as I requested? I'm really frustrated with the whole process. I don't get an insurance book from my company that informs me of # of visits per year or copays. Nor was I informed of this by Benchmark. Yet I hear them tell other patients that they have only one more visit left. I can only surmise that I must somehow be ""different"", and not in a good way. And that is not sitting well with me as I write this review. I've been other places for PT and never felt like I was put on the ""back burner"" until now. I think it's an inexcusable way to run a business personally."
90,MED_12,"Dr. Megan is absolutely the BEST!! I love coming to this Benchmark. Asia who runs the front desk is professional, courteous and helpful. Even though this location is right on Peachtree, they have easy parking and great hours if you're worried about fighting traffic.If you need PT, the light, fun environment provided here helps recovery go quickly!"
91,MED_13,Elizabeth and staff were fantastic! I was a little anxious about my first visits and everyone put me at ease. Thank you
92,MED_19,"This pharmacy defines professionalism and truly goes out of their way to make customers happy. Aside from being super quick and accurate- which yes is important I have had my fair share of wrong medications given to me at cvs, they go out of their way to make your day brighter. They are so kind and helpful. I forgot to put my new insurance card in my wallet. They asked me a few questions and were able to sort it out for me. They are knowledgeable and always answer my questions professionally. This company as a whole is wonderful. I have visited other stores for medical supplies and other things and I'll never go to another pharmacy again."
93,MED_19,"I've had it with Horton & Converse.  They currently have some staff that have no interest in helping customers, one of the staff is an unhelpful woman who is passive aggressive, and must not be happy with herself.  I've given them a year's trial and consistently they have been out of my drugs, only partially filled prescriptions, never helped with insurance or insurance authorization, and not notified me if there was a problem or delay.  I am fighting cancer, I don't want to waste my energy to fight with unpleasant pharmacy clerks who couldn't care less.  I'm moving my scrips as of immediately."
94,MED_19,"Pro: really quick service to get my prescription. The gentleman who helped check me in was professional and took care of checking which of my two insurances were cheaper. I couldn't see the lady in the back, but she was rude and unprofessional. First, she picks up a phone and hangs up, complaining that she couldn't understand anything. Then she asks the gentleman helping me what's wrong with my prescription, and he explains that he's helping me check my two insurances. She probably doesn't think that I can hear her, but she's says ""oh geez!"" as if what I am asking is inconvenient for them. I manage a pharmacy and this is typical of what goes on in a pharmacy, and this profession requires lots of patience. Please remember that though your pharmacy counter is high, I can still hear you!!!"
95,MED_19,"I came to this pharmacy for the first time last week to get something to help with my sore throat. I wasn't sure what to get, but the pharmacist, Sanam, actually came out to help me find the right product for my symptoms! They have an excellent over the counter selection and homeopathic products you won't find everywhere else. Sure, you might be able to get a few better prices at a bigger chains but you'll never get this kind of personal service. I will be back!"
96,MED_19,"As ususal anyone who has a chronic pain codition knows the search one must do to have your script filled. I know longer when I am told "" Sorry we are out"" it means we are holding it for our friends. As usual I went to Hortons and was told the "" Sorry we are out why dont you go to a pharmacy that is near your doctors office"" Sorry if I came here no pharmacies in the area only 2 miles from here do not carry it. The serve a select crowd who use their medication for recrational use."
97,MED_19,Really great pharmacist and staff. John always has great advice and everything you could possibly need. If they don't have it they will order it!
98,MED_19,This is a great pharmacy. Very professional and friendly staff. They always go out of their way to fix any prescription issues and help in any way they can.
99,MED_19,I don't usually write reviews on yelp but the staff at this pharmacy ALWAYS go above and beyond to take care of me and my family... great pharmacy!! Highly recommended!
100,MED_19,I love this pharmacy!! The staff is very helpful all the time and give great service. I recommend it to all my friends and family.
101,MED_19,"They've been filling the same script for 5 years....today the insurance made an error...the pharmacy could not have been less helpful. (i over heard the older pharmacist tell his younger/future replacement ""you could call his insurance"". No such luck.... the scary looking younger pharmacist refused to call. Not the first time they've been rude....the entire staff is unfriendly and filled with attitude. Fortunately one call to the insurance cleared up their problem.....getting it filled somewhere else tomorrow.LOST MY BUSINESS FOR GOOD."
102,MED_19,"Horribly, horribly, horribly overpriced place for meds. Needed Tylenol 3's that my dentist in the same building prescribed and they charged me $35 for 20 pills when Rite-Aid only charges $20 for 28 pills. You do the math."
103,MED_19,This Horton and Converse Pharmacy has the nicest pharmacist and staff. They always fill my prescription quickly. They validate parking--bonus! I switched to this pharmacy over a year ago after I just had it with Pavilions. Very pleased with my switch!
104,MED_19,"This is my second time here. I will never come back, even though it is convenient to my doctor. Both times I have been here, the staff seems absolutely annoyed to help, totally disinterested in me as a customer, and rude, as if I am interrupting something important. There are so many pharmacies that isn't so disrespectful."
105,MED_19,"Great pharmacy with awesome staff. Ridiculously expensive. Would give 5 stars...but they charge WAY more than any other pharmacy. Case in point, for an 8 pack of Gillette Fusion (not the Fusion Power...but regular old Fusion) razor cartridges it costs $44.75 at Horton & Converse...while it costs $40.99 FOR A 12 PACK of the same razor cartridges at every other pharmacy in LA. Ridiculous prices."
106,MED_19,"The best pharmacist ever! The pharmacist, whose identity I'm keeping quiet about so the drug companys don't send their cronies after him/her, not only tapdanced to cheer me up, but was caring enough to tell me to request new prescriptions from my doctor to save me hundreds and hundreds of dollars. The pharmacist has a great 'if this person was my kid' manner and attentiveness which I haven't found in many people in Los Angeles."
107,MED_19,I love this place. Going here makes me feel like I live in a small town where everyone knows my name and isn't an asshole (basically makes me forget I am in LA.)
108,MED_20,Elizabeth and staff were fantastic! I was a little anxious about my first visits and everyone put me at ease. Thank you
109,MED_21,"I am the mother of a child in recovery and I am confident that R & R (Road to Recovery) has to be studied and emulated as the optimal model for success in recovery. Our family has had several attempts at recovery, and by far R &R offers the most productive approach! Here are a few differences, in my opinion, between the R &R program and the offerings of the majority of well-intentioned, but poorly structured rehab solutions:1. A long-term integrated and progressive program with a focus on the individual needs in recoveryMost of the Rehab's offer 30 days stay (that is what the insurance would normally cover). After this short period, the person in the very early stage of recovery is given a referral to an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) and a recommendation for a Clean and Sober Living facility. At the very best, the staff of the rehab has some general familiarity with the transitional places that they recommend, but there is hardly any follow up or coordination among rehab, IOP and Clean and Sober Living. Clean and Sober Living facilities are not well-regulated, and the chances that your loved one will wind up in the environment that is less than optimal for the recovery are actually very high.R & R, in contrast, has all the steps of the recovery accommodated under one roof, so to speak. From rehab the person transitions to an intensive IOP that is integrated with Clean and Sober Living: same general location, same team of counselors, same group of recovering men who attend the IOP together and support each other in Recovery at Clean and Sober Living.The IOP program is excellent! It is very engaging; it is based in solid research and staffed by true professionals. The transportation between IOP and Clean and Sober is provided, and the Clean and Sober facility is extremely well supervised without being oppressive. There is a sense of true camaraderie and optimism among the recovering community!2. Medical and Therapeutic SupportThe medical staff at a typical rehab is composed primarily of nurses who are usually great at the initial steps of recovery that involves detox, but they are not trained in a professional support that is specific to addiction recovery. Therapy normally focuses on the behavioral aspects, and groups are commonly led by well-intentioned but barely trained individuals. The engagement of the person in recovery dwindles very quickly; groups become ""same old,"" and half of the time in rehab is spent in lingering - ""doing time.""R & R offers real addiction doctors, serious professional therapists trained in several modalities. The IOP program is progressive - from intense to more relaxed, and it is timed according to the individual circumstances of the participant. IOP covers many salient aspects of recovery in a truly engaging and challenging context that is reminiscent of the best university seminars.3. Involvement with the 12-Step ProgramsMost of the rehabs will take patients to the nearby AA meetings and recommend that recovering addicts continue with attending meetings past their stay in rehab. It is easier said than done.R & R takes men in recovery to the AA meetings daily and provides transportation to the meetings. If the person has a particular preference for certain meetings - they will take him there. The treatment team at R & R knows your loved one's sponsor, knows what step he is working on, supports his progress in AA.4. Personal Accommodations R & R goes out of its way to accommodate existing personal support in recovery! They will take you to appointments when necessary, help with job search, interviews, school applications.5. Recovery is Fun at R & R!Ryan and Dylan (two super-dedicated, high-energy, deeply caring co-founders of R & R) take groups of guys in recovery to sports events, concerts, to the beach and beyond. Ryan and Dylan bring joy back into the lives of the recovering men who have suffered so much in addiction.6. Communication and the Safety CloudWhen your loved one stays in rehab, staff and treatment team will give you updates, but once he or she transitions to IOP and Clean and Sober Living - all updates are over. As a parent or a spouse, you are left in the dark with your constant fear of relapse.I have not waited for more than 30 minutes for a response to my text message to Ruin or Dylan. You can request and schedule a phone update any time; you can get in touch with the manager at Clean and Sober Living any time. And if, God forbid, a relapse happens - all the help is right there to attend to the problem! This is such a great relief!I cannot express how happy I am that my child is recovering in this unique program! I would hope that any person suffering from addiction finds such great care!"
110,MED_21,"Dylan and Ryan who run R & R are so amazing!!!My husband and I are so thankful for their program. Our son is a totally different person that we haven't seen in years. Our son has been to eight different rehabs from the age of 14 through 23 and place is the first place that he has liked and he totally got transformed by the program they offer. As parents, we were so tired and worn out from years of seeing our son suffer, this place is such a blessing. Ryan, Dylan and all the staff were so kind and we are grateful they took a chance with our son. We highly recommend this place!Kindly,Michelle"
111,MED_21,"R&R Recovery has changed my life and the lives of my loved ones. I've been to treatment centers all over the country and never had a treatment experience that not only helped me with the difficult beginning months of early sobriety effectively, but really set me up to be successful in recovery and in life.I came to R&R not knowing anyone in Huntington Beach and was welcomed immediately by Dylan and Ryan as well as the guys in the program. A big difference between R&R and other programs is that guys that finish are welcome to come back and attend groups if they are doing well after finishing the program, so there are a lot of good examples and established paths to follow and learn from. The groups are not the typical worksheets and videos day after day. While I attended we had weekly visits from different therapists, art therapists and every Tuesday Mitch would come in as an expert on nutrition and exercise. The cool part was we were always doing something fun, whether it was part of programming or just Ryan, Dylan, Sean and Cameron taking us out and doing stuff, whether it was going to the gym, playing basketball or spikeball, bowling, movies, dinner, ice-cream filled donuts, breakfast on Sugar Cack Tuesday's with cool Dad, rap shows in LA with VIP access, Clippers games or fishing trips to Catalina Island there was always something to look forward to.Another part that set R&R apart was the way they treat you on a daily basis, not like a client but like a friend they genuinely want to see succeed. If you express your needs they will do their best to give you the access to make it happen. R&R is invested in each client for the long haul, when I came Dylan immediately helped me get my resume fixed up so I could start looking for work and get setup to finish my bachelors degree. Another great aspect that I did not notice while going through treatment was they empowered you in the way you made your own decisions, you had structure but also freedom, a nice balance that helped me transition to exiting treatment and transitioning into working my own recovery program successfully while getting back to normal life and moving forward.At this moment I have over 7 months sober and that is all thanks to R&R, I am incredibly grateful and my family couldn't be happier with R&R."
112,MED_21,"I'm a ""veteran"" parent in this drug use disorder war, with many just adequate treatment centers over my son's last 7 years. Here's why I think R & R has provided a superior program: The co-founders, Ryan and Dylan are young, smart, knowledgable and progressive in their long term views of treatment. They are direct and solution oriented. My son's program has truly been individualized. His caseworker, Cameron, has been and continues to be a significant support and example of what clear, goal setting looks and feels like. He's a gem...There's positive, fun energy in this treatment program and it's apparent each time I come for a meeting with my son and the staff. They also give my son space to make adult decisions. My son has been able to fill his life in treatment and sober living with a great balance of positive activities, meetings, work, college, and now, a community of really good friends. I have learned over the years that recovery is a much longer road than I ever expected. I was very pleased (and relieved) that R & R offers specific ongoing support for those who are taking the next steps in moving past rehab. My son has worked hard while in R & R Recovery and I am very proud of him. I am also hugely grateful to this place and the people there that change lives."
113,MED_21,I am a mom of an addict. My son has been to a various number of treatment centers. R&R Recovery is an amazing treatment center and the best. The director Dylan is personally involved with the clients and really cares personally about their recovery. This place goes over and beyond. There are so many treatment centers to chose from and it can be overwhelming. I highly reccomend R & R Recovery to any parent looking for a center for their child or if you are having trouble with addiction this is the BEST place to go for help.
114,MED_21,"R&R is one of the best treatment centers you can find for yourself or a loved one to go to. The whole team (from support staff to owners) care an immense amount about client care and helping others. R & r recovery has high standards for ethics, strong work ethic and creative ideas to help clients have fun in sobriety and receive the therapy they need. Treatment is individualized and clients are not considered numbers here. I hope you love R&R as much as I do!"
115,MED_21,"R & R Recovery is one of the very few treatment centers that does things right all the way around. Clts are given personal and individualized care that goes way beyond what most treatment centers offer. If you are serious about recovery and getting your life back, there is no better place to go."
116,MED_23,The physical therapists are great at Southern Rehab.  I have had to go through rehab with them on two occasions and have had my son there with sports injuries on numerous occasions. They were attentive and assisted me and my son with reaching our recovery much sooner than expected.
117,MED_23,What a horrible place. All one room and beds are 2' apart. Nothing like having some stranger's backside in your face. 3 visits scheduled with same PT and got a guy on the 2nd visit clearly annoyed and left me on machines and disappeared the entire time. 3rd was a student. Nothing like paying $200+ to be ignored to work out on your own. $600 for 3 hours.
118,MED_26,"I am amazed how good this large organization is run! From the front desk to the Doctors everyone is great! I know sometimes the schedule may get slowed down, but I think it's because the doctors take as much time as needed with each patient. This is not a Resturant trying to turn tables as fast as possible! Everyone is sincerely concerned about their patients. I highly recommend this organization for ANY ISSUES YOU HAVE WITH BONE AND MUSCLE ORIENTED HEALTH!"
119,MED_26,"Kissimmee, Florida location. Terrible customer service. I called and asked to make a new patient apt and was placed on hold for over 15 minutes. They picked up and had no clue why I was on hold. During the scheduling process I told them my ankle and knee needed to be treated and they told me the doctor would only see me for 1 area not both. What kind of physician will see you for only 1 orthopedic issue? Never in my life have I heard of this before, I have worked in the medical field for over 15 years! Giving my business to someone else!"
120,MED_26,"I highly recommend any of the Hughston clinic surgeons. I am both a patient and employee of the clinic, and I wouldn't trust anywhere else with my orthopedic needs."
121,MED_27,"Had a wonderful experience here as I've been dealing with my back issues. Dr. Small is very professional and listens/understands as all PTs should, but many don't. I left with lots of strategies and ways I can self-treat my issues with stretching--overall, though, he's got a great way about him and the support staff was super friendly and accommodating. If you're having issues, it's highly recommended."
122,MED_27,"I have had an amazing experience there. the staffs are very nice, friendly, and they always welcome me. I have issues with my back and knees and so far with Mrs. Emma, I feel much better. She knows what she is doing and is patient when sometime I don't know how to explain in English. Whenever I am a concern about my back or my knees, she will listen and explain to me and suggest what to work. Now, I am able to do the excercies at home. Moreover, she is easy to talk, and friendly. I never felt uncomfortable with them, so thank you all."
123,MED_29,"Steve Clark has been my physical therapist for 3-4 months now. I have a couple of injuries that keep wanting to slow me down but Steve and his right-hand women Sidney Garcia help me keep my injuries at bay. They are a great team.First off, Steve is an amazing physical therapist. He knows his stuff. I've seen several physical therapists and he's the best I've seen. He's incredibly knowledgeable. He brings decades of experience to the table. He's always learning. He improves his skills often. Additionally, he practices what he preaches and incorporates his physical therapy teachings in his own life. This guys is in his mid-50s but is in better shape than I am and I'm 30. He's fully invested in what he does. He's passionate about it. He's a guy you want to work with. Secondly, Steve is an amazing conversationalist. I love to shoot the breeze and Steve and I have developed an amazing friendship. We talk about everything. Who needs a clinical therapist when you've got Steve? Haha. Seriously though, he is interested in getting into the meat of life - interested in talking about things that really matter - love, friendship, finding ways to better yourself, etc. If you've read a cool book recently tell Steve about it and he just might go read it himself. One of his patients loves classical music and so he started listening to classical music in his free time. There is a TEDx talk that I really like and I told him about it. He went home and actually listened to it. We spent the entire next session talking about it... I love talking to Steve about his family. He is a good man. He cares about his wife and kids. They are lucky to have a strong confident person like him in their life. He is a rock. He's not perfect and he'll be the first one to tell you that, but he cares and does a damn good job. He's always wanting to improve. If there is something that he can do better than he wants to know it. He wants you to tell him about it. These are the kinds of people that I want to be surrounded with. Lastly, I couldn't leave an Athletic Physical Therapy review without talking up Sidney Garcia who is Steve's Physical Therapy Assistant. She is a wonderful and beautiful young woman who I have also become good friends with. I work on high-level things with Steve that require his immediate attention and skill as a Physical Therapist, but a lot of my time I spend with Sidney doing my routine exercises like leg press, calf raises, hip thrusters, etc. She keeps me on track. She's got a great service oriented attitude. Together they make a great team. Who knows, maybe she'll be running the company someday? I think she has a great career ahead as a physical therapist or some other health profession. Whatever she chooses to pursue. Overall, I've loved my time with Steve and Sidney. I look forward to seeing them and improving my health each time that I have an appointment. Thanks guys! Let's keep on crushing it every single appointment. I'll see you both soon :) I'm looking forward to it."
124,MED_29,"After my rotator cuff surgery I did physical therapy here and was happy with the results. I worked primarily with Steve and Gloria and they are both knowledgable, friendly, patient and caring. I began PT a week after surgery. They started me off slowly and would gradually build up the movements, weights and resistance-- nothing was ever rushed or pushed harder than it needed to be, which I appreciated. Setting up appointments was always easy and I had no issues with billing, they made sure all of that went as smoothly as possible."
125,MED_29,As good as they come. Very professional and thorough . I especially liked my trainer Steve. I would ask for him
126,MED_29,"They were excellent from the start. After an ACL surgery, my knee is pain free and I'm back to hiking and playing sports. They are accommodating and open their clinic super early in the morning which is great for those who work early morning jobs. Thanks Steve and Gloria!"
127,MED_29,"Steve Crear and Gloria Martinez make a great team. Excellent understanding of patient needs, particularly for those over 60. I never felt rushed in and out. Facility is conveniently located on Wilshire with no charge for parking. They treated me after my right knee replacement in October 2018 and I look forward to returning after my left knee replacement this coming October 2019."
128,MED_29,"Steve Clark is awesome!, Smart, great at getting to the heart of the issue and pushing as hard as I can go and if I say it's too much we slow down a bit. I've been going there for 7 months for my left ankle and started there because I developed Plantar Fascitis, which is a real bear of a condition. Had my left ankle operated on two weeks ago and will be back at it later this week. He even identified the likely culprit, overcompensation\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b of one foot/ankle for what's\xe2\x80\x8b been going on with\xe2\x80\x8b the other. My left ankle has been a problem for over 30 years. Sydnee, who works for him is very nice and attentive too. She's not a therapist, rather an assistant and works with me when I'm off table doing exercises, and she does the scheduling. They're within a small gym and they validate for your parking in the underneath garage--on the corner of Wilshire and Centinela."
129,MED_29,Steve was great! In a week I went from barely getting around with crutches to walking without crutches and no brace ! Steve was super experienced.
130,MED_29,"The staff are extremely nice but I can't say I was happy with my experience here. I came here for physical therapy after I broke my leg in a moped accident in 2015. Initially it really helped my healing process but I eventually felt like I hit a plateau. I felt like my trainer was not fully tracking my progress and I'd go in expecting to progress further and end up being told to do the same things. They'd also leave me alone for long stretches of time on a workout machine not really knowing what to do. I needed guidance and didn't get much. I feel like my trainer had far too many patients going back and forth and wasn't focused on any of us enough. He'd leave me with staff that were barely finished training, and not a certified pt. I would have preferred professional help as promoted on their website, not trainees with no experience. I'm young and wanted to regain my strength but I felt like I wasn't given enough help. This facility is also a regular gym and it was extremely saddening and embarrassing to be around all these healthy active people when I'm trying to heal from a serious injury. I have a limited time for my appointments and we'd have to wait for gym goers to finish on machines we'd need to use. That is a waste of my time! I was lucky enough to have this covered by insurance but 2 appointments a week at $25 copays each adds up and I had already been financially drained from the injury and surgery I had to undergo. The staff would constantly ask about the accident and whether I was going to ride a moped again, which was still a really sore subject I didn't need to dredge up twice a week. I was even reprimanded for riding. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but staff should keep that to themselves, really. I was already badly hurt physically and emotionally. I didn't need the lack of consideration. As a gym, this place seems fine. As physical therapy, it sucked. It is not worth the price. They do not pay attention to patients' individual needs. And I feel like they cater more to the Medicare crowd than someone who needs rehab from a traumatic accident.I would not recommend this place for physical therapy. They get 2 stars for being friendly, sort of."
131,MED_29,"This place is absolutely wonderful with extremely kind staff! Gloria is always courteous and caters to however one is feeling that day as you leave with a happy smile :) When I sprained my ankle and wrist, Andre and Kyle made sure I was feeling better each time I came in ( I go to Life Gym where PT is located) even if I was not here for PT and gave me various exercises to do to help with my injuries.I can always rely on this staff and I know that everyone who is here agrees as well :)Thank you!"
132,MED_29,"I worked with Morgan Christy and her assistant, Sydney, for about 6 weeks for my sciatica and hamstring pain. I have never had a better experience with physical therapy. Morgan is a healer! All of the exercises given helped me to heal quickly and I am happy to say, my leg pain is gone!"
133,MED_29,"This physical therapy clinic is fantastic. The physical therapist are so knowledgeable and definitely make you feel comfortable. Really enjoyed working with Steve and his tech, Gloria. Overall great staff and location!"
134,MED_29,"The Athletic PT staff is kind, attentive, and very knowledgeable. Facilities are clean and well managed. The actual physical therapy office is located inside Life Gym. Parking is free for 2 hours with validation. I would definitely recommend this clinic."
135,MED_29,"Steve was very caring and gentle & obviously knows what he is doing. I have the ultimate confidence in him. I saw him for my back few years ago and when I injured myself this time, I was desperate to find him and have him work on my shoulder. The improvement is amazing. Would definitely recommend their facility to anyone who is looking for a positive experience."
136,MED_29,"Highly professional physical therapy clinic. Gloria is an aide there and she is fantastic. I definitely needed a plan that worked with my busy schedule. They were able to accommodate nicely. If I need PT again I will definitely go here. It was organized, professional, and I really felt like they cared about me and my welfare. That gets a high recommendation from me!"
137,MED_29,"The PT staff is one of the best out there. Kind, friendly, and progressive. They won't waste your time. The most knowledgeable crew I've seen in a long time. Good to know my clients are safe and secure with them."
138,MED_29,"Steve Creer is a good & knowledgeable therapist, I had a good experience over 8 weeks w/good results. However, if your looking for a lot of focused / one on one attention, you're probably going to be a little disappointed. Steve is a BUSY man and rotates several patients (up to 4 or 5 sometimes) at a time. If you don't need a lot of hand holding, you won't be disappointed."
139,MED_29,"I work in the gym with Athletic Physical Therapy and they are amazing!!! They are attentive, informative, punctual, and very educated. They help me with my clients everyday and I feel very confident in them. They have amazing ice packs too haha The facility is clean and private, anyone would feel comfortable here :)"
140,MED_29,"The PTs and the PT aides are knowledgeable and attentive. They make sure that you are comfortable and try to give you appointments that work best for you. They also do not kick you out when your time is up and let you stay around to get heat or ice. I've also seen them cleaning off the beds after every patient and do the laundry a lot. Their billing department is also patient.The aide that used to work there was very fun and kind. Their aides are patient and make sure you do your exercises properly. They make you feel at home, which is the most important thing whenever I have to see any medical professional. (I have to say though, even though the other aide doesn't work there anymore, since she was my favorite, I would still go back to them first if I had to)"
141,MED_29,Steve worked on my shoulder and helped me get through a bad injury. I feel stronger than ever before.
142,MED_29,"The staff is very polite and helpful. They were caring from the minute I called which helped me make the decision and go to them. After a few weeks of treatment, I know I made the right decision."
143,MED_32,"I am so thankful I chose Hayden for my therapy. I first met with Mike Hyde, a PT. He was so thorough in understanding my issue, empathetic to my situation, and provides great therapy. The assistants there are amazing, too. Each one is personal and kind, efficient, and attentive. I am self-pay and the rate is reasonable. Thankful for a great place to go that is close to home."
144,MED_34,"I ran a lot in my younger days, but due to less than ideal ankles and my leg's pre-disposition to heavy stress (genuvalgum), I ran to the point of where it hurt enough for my jaws to clench simply walking across campus or going down the stairs. No one really knew what was going on, but the doctors told me to either seek physical therapy or orthopaedics if necessary. I didn't have the time to go physical therapy, and orthopaedics seemed daunting. With no way of understanding what was going on, I stopped running. I gained 15 pounds my first year and 10 more the second year...I mentioned that I wanted to run again to my current doctors at Kaiser (they are fantasic!), who figured out what I had and sent me off to physical therapy.I chose this place since it's close to me, and love the staff here. My treatment for PFS (runner's knee) included several different exercises to build strength, as well as a sonic deep tissue ""treatment"". Appointments shouldn't last more than 30-40minutes, and the staff here are very friendly and accommodating. The road to healing was pretty long, but I can now actually run for more than 5 minutes without that awful, resonating pain in my knees. I really want to thank PA. I recently experienced that runner's high again for the first time in two years (runners, you know what I'm talking about). I am so thankful for the advice they've given and work they've done on me."
145,MED_34,"Good variety of equipment that they keep clean . They know how to ""create "" things that work! Example two tennis balls taped strategically apart to massage my neck . Worked perfectly! Dylan and Katlin worked well together and know the meaning of team work! Bonus their therapy actually makes a difference in both my torn meniscus and rotator cuff"
146,MED_34,"I have been going to Caitlyn for the past 4 months to address ongoing neck issues that I have battled on and off for over 20 years. Right as I started PT, I fell and broke my ankle, so we had to add therapy for my ankle as well. Caitlyn was simply amazing! She's very knowledgeable, kind and patient. Highly recommend.My husband also goes to PT and sees Dylan. Everything I said about Caitlyn applies to Dylan as well!"
147,MED_34,I've been going here with injuries resulting a accident. My PT is Danielle and she's so sweet. She has another person that she helps whenever I'm there. I've never had PT so I am not sure if that is the norm. The staff here is friendly and informative.
148,MED_34,"I want to thank Dylan, Caitlin, Rachel and Rod for being so kind to me during my time at Physiotherapy Associates. I had physical therapy as the result of a car accident. My lower back, left shoulder and arm were really in pain and I could barely turn my head to the left.  It was a really scary time. Dylan and Caitlin were friendly, caring, patient and knowledgable. During each visit Dylan and Caitlin took me through various exercises and explained how they would help. They also used various techniques to bring me relief, i.e tens unit, massage and dry needling. When one thing didn't work we went on to the next thing. Dry needling hurts initially, but it was effective. They gave me exercises to do at home and showed me how to do them to make sure I did them correctly while on my own. Thank you again to Dylan, Caitlin and the entire staff."
149,MED_34,I received fantastic treatment at Physio for a nagging shoulder injury. The staff genuinely care about their patients and provide detailed explanation along with excellent care and at-home exercises. Highly recommended for any PT needs!
150,MED_34,"Physical therapy was okay, but the billing is a nightmare. My therapy was not covered by insurance so I paid the amount the company indicated for each visit out of pocket before each session. I was never given any indication that I was not paying the full amount for the attention I received. However, months later I received a statement showing additional charges added to almost all of my visits and a balance now due. I tried to call the company to get an explanation for the charges but could never reach a live person. My only option was to leave a message that was never returned. Then, every few days or so, I would receive a robocall from the company. When I answered I would be put on hold for up to ten minutes then disconnected without a live person ever getting on the line. This happened dozens of times. I was never able to speak to a live person and the extraneous charges were never explained. Take your business elsewhere. PA is just in the business of billing, not helping you get well."
151,MED_34,"I had nothing but positive experiences with everyone who worked there, from the front desk to the doctor, everyone was wonderful! Personalized treatment by people who actually cared. Highly recommended and will go back again!"
152,MED_34,Disclaimer :This update has nothing to do with the staff or doctors. My main complaint is with the business operations and billing process here. I got charge incorrectly on one of my visit and I've been trying to resolve the issue for the last couple of months with no success. It is very frustrating and I don't want others to have to go through the same pain. Please make sure to review your statements and ask questions immediately.
153,MED_34,"Dylan and Tim are friendly, caring, professional and knowledgeable. They took great care of me. I highly recommend this facility and staff!"
154,MED_34,"Nader Alhooie, DPT has been treating my lower back injury (L4, 5, S1) Piriformis Syndrome, & IT band pain since April. I don't know what I would have done without his expertise, amazing bedside manner, and clay heat packs! I highly recommend this location for all your ailments, especially when you're dealing with any debilitation...each of the staff members are super nice, and the clean facilities with amazing tree line views are just what you'll need to get back up and at 'em! I'll actually miss going here now that I'm better!!!"
155,MED_34,"Great place for PT and super friendly and assistive staff! They always work with your schedule and let you know if your therapist is going to be out and you need to reschedule. The front desk staff, Holly and Malorie, are always so nice and patient and assist you with any questions or needs you have. I had therapy with Dylan who is just the best!!! I had been dealing with plantar fasciitis for years and doing doctor prescribed stretching and icing with no results. I asked my doctor to try ""dry needling"" and from the very first session it provided immediate refief. Over the course of treatment it has completely changed my life. The dry needling is a little ""uncomfortable"" compared to other treatment options but nothing compared to my daily pain and it is nothing compared to the severe option of surgery. I can't thank Dylan and Phsio enough for the relief and change in my feet and my life. I would recommend anyone trying dry needling if it is an option for their condition. It is a serious ""no knife/no drugs"" way to go. Thanks Dylan!"
156,MED_34,"I work for the City of Atlanta Police Department and recently got injured while at work. I pulled my intercostal muscle and trapezius muscle which eventually put a very painful strain on the muscles in my shoulder. At one point my muscles were strained so bad, I had trouble breathing. I was hesitant about physical therapy because I had never done it before and haven't heard all positives things from friends and family. But to my surprise I was thoroughly pleased with each visit. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Both the physical therapist (Dylan) and his assistant (Tim) provided my with at home exercises to strengthen my shoulder after each session. I went to physically therapy for about two months and now feel 100% better. I would definitely recommend the needle therapy if you have muscle spasms like I was having (don't worry it's not painful). The office and equipment are all clean and well kept as well. The billing process was very easy for me as well. I just paid with a card at the end of each session."
157,MED_35,"Tara, Christina, Jordan, Dominique, and Hannah are AMAZZZING!! Tara has taken my hair from box dyed level 3 to level 10 in the past 9 months and has kept it soft, shiney, healthy and long every step of the way. We always have fun chatting and she's always ready to assist me when I pop in for questions about products. Everyone here is so well trained and professional. They have absolutely earned my customer loyalty. I love my hair and I love the Santa Rosa Ave Salon team at Ulta!!"
158,MED_35,"This Ulta is well stocked and incredibly clean. The staff is always helpful and patient with my 5 thousand questions. The salon sets it apart. My absolute favorite stylist in northern California works there! Hannah's youthe only person ever able to tame these locks and match my Auburn color to the tee. I've been to every high end salon, paid so much more. She's pretty booked so get your appt online now!"
159,MED_35,"If I could give zero stars, I would. Third time in a year looking to buy Anastasia brow wiz product and third time my color was not in stock, nor was my second choice. Then I asked for help from a completely uninterested sales woman to find CC Cream. When I said I think I want to look at Clinique she said I needednsuch-and-such shade th length was unable to locate it. She literally stood there looking around helplessly until finally just saying I cant find it"", not ""let's find something else"", or can I order it for you. Just ""I can't find it. Then she walked away and went back to chatting with the other uninterested sales people. Last visit. Ugh."
160,MED_35,"Had a fantastic experience with George! Firstly he was well dressed and professionally on point! Greeted me upon entering and immediately helped me pick my Bare Minerals shade. He made my day. Super kind, patient and really cared that I got the right shade. Not so great was the woman at the counter not looking up at any customers calling customers right in earshot of the line about rescheduling her appointments at the brow bar due to family issues. Hey, I get it, but not cool with only 1 staff at the register and a line. One woman came to assist the girl at the register but then left didn't even look at the line. It's funny usually they have too many at register and no one on floor or help or vice versa. C'mon ladies figure it out! This is a great store just needs more mature management. Just replicate George and this place will be poppin!"
161,MED_35,Why do you have a fragrance out but no tester? I wanted to spray the new Ralph Lauren perfume to see how it smelled like but there was no tester out so I asked an associate for help. He said that since I don't see it here it means that they don't have a tester for it because CORPORATE has to send the tester out for them to even OPEN it! I think this is a lame procedure because now I'm not going to even buy it because I don't know how it smells like! I've never had a good experience with Ulta and this experience reminds me of why I should just stick to Sephora. The thing that pissed me off was his answer and attitude sounded so lazy like it was a chore even if he was to make a tester out of a fragrance. I will no longer come into this location.
162,MED_35,"I went in for a hair cut and color. I was nervous but the stylist, Katrina, was very professional and really knew what she was talking about. She took into consideration how I felt and had great recommendations for what I should get. The service was great! I look super cute now, and the price was very reasonable. The store was clean, the employees were friendly, and paying was a breeze. I didn't even know they had a salon in the store, but they do! I highly recommend it!"
163,MED_35,Made a hair appointment and the hair dresser wasn't even there. The manager was the one who told me she wasn't there with an attitude! I was nice and she wasn't even sorry. As a manager you think she would care about her customer.
164,MED_35,"Hannah did such an awesome job on my hair. I made an appointment last minute and asked her for suggestions and she was amazing!! My daughter also got her eyebrows done by Catherine and they came out perfect! Thank you Ulta, Hannah and Catherine!! I'll be back forsure"
165,MED_35,"I was denied an appointment twice for lack of scheduling properly. I came in on Monday 8/19 when the brow bar hours are operating. They have hours of operation signs posted on the brow bar so this is how I knew. My usual brow bar girl holly wasn't in. Neither was anyone. Cool, it wasted drive but no big deal but kind of disappointed. I make an appointment explaining I only have tomorrow to come in because I'm leaving for NYC in a couple days. Cool got the appointment booked for 1:15 I come in and everyone is ignoring me. I tell the front staff I have an appointment with Holly and that's never communicated to her. Eventually after watching her do someone else's brows I again approach the front and then am told I don't have an appointment. I was literally just in the prior day booking an appointment and explaining my time crunch. I was again denied today and told to come back at 3 pm. It wasn't even 2pm mind you, so they wanted me to wait over an hour for a brow appointment they messed up on. I honestly went back in to explain my frustration with the staff at how I've now wasted tons of hours, money, etc. driving up out of my way to be turned away. This was kind of just ridiculous, the staff seemed to be u bothered and care less that they made such a huge mistake. I guess I've learned my lesson, stuck to the nicer salons and skip the brow bars \xe2\x80\x8d"
166,MED_35,"I have shopped at this store atleast twice . The first time i walked in was for some lashes . There was 2 ladies that were standing to greet people and i saw when they greeted a woman that came in before me . I stepped in and they just gave me dirty looks . The second time i shopped, they did the same exact thing as if i was invisible."
167,MED_35,"Huge store, well organized, lots of staff and check out looks speedy. There are no bargains here. Dept store prices. My favorite Kenra 25 Hair spray is $4 (four) more there than at the high end beauty supply store I love.Huge selection of NYX....more expensive than Bed Bath Beyond, and a vast assortment Even the cover girl mascara is a couple dollars more than Walgreens etcWanted to buy IT Cosmetics, the sales member must have been new...Beautiful store...must be flagship...much better than the other two I've seen."
168,MED_35,"SCARY skin care advice, I was in the beauty industry for years mostly in skin care....anyhow walked up to grab face wash and overheard an associate recommending Murad Hydraquinone to a VERY dark skinned woman with an even darker hyperpigmentation spot on her face. The customer wanted to know if it was safe on her very dark skin and for her very sensitive skin. Employee said it should be fine and to just apply it before moisturizing. This product is very strong and never be used on dark skin, sensitive skin or during the day!!! Ohhh no!!!!! Are you kidding me?! I like the selection there and I don't need advice but please Ulta, training your staff is important for customers who don't have the knowledge. This poor lady might now end up with serious issues!"
169,MED_35,"Mothers day. When in to find a present for a couple mamas. I went in and I am being stared out before I come in by a few employees and they are also looking at my little 5 yr old son and 5 yr old my neice. I go to the back make sure they dont touch anything as I am watching them. They saw 2 couches they wanted to sit and so I let them as I can see them. After less than 2 min There was a small thump, so I look and make sure nothing was drop or nothing was being touched. Only to see how an employee stops his conversation after seeing that I am there making sure everything was ok peeking his head over and over. Kids where calm and quit and the gentleman just stood there so I didnt feel comfortable and left. Walked to the front was looking at shadow with the little one ( again making sure they aren't touching) and my neice goes to the floor to grab sothing another gal employee comes over and is watching us like a hawk is is literally in front of me just watching us. Ugh. So I leave. They have amazing greeting, was extremely disappointed that I was not able to shop with out the hanging over me."
170,MED_35,"This is my first Ulta I have ever been into. Wow......and what a HUGE store.If you have cash to drop and time to spend, come into this store. It will make you go broke and occupy you at the same time. Ulta is broken into 2 parts of the store. One side is low end items you would find in Target or CVS. The other side is about quadruple the price for their higher end materials. Ulta has you completely cover for all of your girly necessities. Make up, bodywash, lotions, perfumes, shampoo, conditioners, polish, blow dryers, flat irons......THEY HAVE IT ALL!!!!!!!!!! I have had pretty good customers service when I have gone in there. Each time I enter their store, I have ways been greeted by someone asking me if I need any help. There seems to be plenty of associates willing to help. There is also a full service salon. However, I have not used their services."
171,MED_35,"I had been going to Ashley at Benefit for my brows for years, but when she left I was so sad! I tried 4 different people before finally finding Kelsey at the Benefit in Ulta on Santa Rosa Avenue! She is amazing! Some girls were too rough and harsh and others were way too soft and left tons of hair behind. I like my brows thicker but I still want an arch and no extra little hairs left! Kelsey is the best! Very soft handed, but still removes all excess hair and gives my brows back their amazing shape! Only downside is she rarely works Saturdays and Sundays and since I work until 5:30 M-F i don't always get her. However, Kathryn is also very good! She waxes a lot like Kelsey and again always brings my brows back to life! Also love getting all my lashes, mascara, eyebrow gel, and hair products here! Reasonably priced and I signed up for rewards which helps used money towards a purchase."
172,MED_35,"I recently purchased a bare minerals foundation, which I've purchased the same color for years. This time the foundation didn't match what was listed. I took it back to Ulta and the staff was super nice and helpful and switched the foundation out for the correct color. Thanks!"
173,MED_35,"Very disappointed in the customer service at this location. Unfortunately had a very uncomfortable experience when checking out with one of the cashiers. When I wasn't interested in giving my personal information, after using a pressuring sales tactic she then decided to call out another customer to use their information making everyone feel incredibly embarrassed. As a person who also works in sales, making your customers feel comfortable should be a priority."
174,MED_35,"So mostly this place is total crap EXCEPT the brow bar. Ashlee has been doing my brows for years, and let me tell you, there is no one better in the business. That woman can take a caterpillar brow, and make you a Kardashian. I can't stress enough how much I love her and her attention to detail. I'll never go to anyone else."
175,MED_35,"My first Ulta visit and I was blown away. This is a huge, beautifully organized store. There are Two sections: Drug Store Make Up and High End Make Up lotions and potionsIt is a very Pretty store - busy staff. Very few bargains.Loved it!"
176,MED_35,"I'll be writing two separate reviews for the salon and the beauty store itself within this one.The Salon:I've been going here for a couple years and finally found my ""go-to-Gal""--Anitra. She is the Salon manager so you're going to be $15-$20 more for the service than the regular stylists but it's 100% worth it. Here's why. June 13th I decided to color my hair for the first time ever from my natural golden blonde to an auburn red, so Anitra and I decided on a Redken Shades EQ Color Gloss which is a semi-permanent dye, but it ended up sticking in my hair, up until now. I loved this color so much and had such a wonderful time with Anitra who was accommodating, reassuring for my first time coloring, and really amazing with her hands!A couple of days ago I wanted a change and my friend said she knew how to do highlights so I trusted her. She ended up bleaching my entire head with splotches all over and completely missed my roots so I made an emergency appointment at Ulta and got Cynthia who was available. Unfortunately, I think there was a miscommunication because I asked to be taken back to my golden blonde and after Cynthia evened my hair out, I had a result of white-grey roots and yellow hair. I couldn't even leave the house. I know she had a hard situation to deal with but I felt stuck after 2 different toners and 4 hours in her seat. $170 later including tip, with something I hated. I called the Salon later that day and they offered a free fix by either the original stylist (Cynthia) or the manager (Anitra), and because of my positive experience with Anitra I went with her. I basically told her to surprise me and she gave me the most beautifully indescribable color of an ashy, yet warm, blondish brunette shade that her and I and several other stylists couldn't put a name on. I'm in love! Even though the service was free, she did a treatment on my hair and styled it for me. I tipped of course because she's amazing. I'll attach photos of my original, my red when I first got it and 3 months later, my later horror story hair, and what Anitra fixed me to today. The Store:I've found this store to be generally well-stocked and the staff to always be super genuinely nice. After my horror with the white/yellow hair described above, I almost bought a box dye and called it quits, but a lady (Alex, beautiful lavender/intentionally grey hair) at the register told me to try the Joico purple shampoo and although it didn't work out it still prevented me from ruining my hair and gave me time to make a rational decision that ended wonderfully. I feel like I've made friends with many of the lovely staff members here and will continue to come back again and again, probably 3-4 times a week Overall, I love my local Ulta and everything that comes with it."
177,MED_36,"Jason Kent Physical Therapy was first recommended to me by my hairdresser who also deals with similar chronic neck and shoulder pain. Then I was referred to him by Axis Pain Center, so I knew he was the right therapist for me. I go to the Warner Robins location off of Osigian Blvd. because it's about 7 minutes from my house. Appointments are easy to schedule, and his hours are flexible. The office is small but always clean and inviting. The staff is friendly, helpful, and they know you on a first name basis. I've only been in therapy for about 2 months going 3x per week, but Jason has been incredible at treating my trigger points and improving flexibility and range of motion. Once my muscles eventually begin to loosen up more I'm confident my nerves will no longer be pinched, or at least I'll be better able to manage this chronic pain that's been interfering with my daily life for the past 2 1/2 years. He also helps with realignment issues and posture problems. I'm a full-time potter, and this type of daily work is literally back breaking.He's been completely professional, and I've experienced more pain relief in 2 months at his practice than I ever did during the year long disaster of Physical Therapy I experienced. Just read my other review. Ladies, you're safe here. Jason is trustworthy, positive, sympathetic, and an expert. He's been a game changer! Highly recommend! I tell everyone about his practice."
178,MED_36,"Generally they're pretty good. They are extremely respectful and it's always, always, ""yes, sir"" or ""yes, ma'am."" He's done everything right to make people comfortable. He's installed security cameras in the main area and the rooms needing more privacy go up maybe seven feet so it's private but not sound proof. Great concept for keeping dignity but protecting therapists and patients from a he said/she said type situation.Rarely do they run late and rarely do they rush you through the therapy.  I don't like their manual evaluations as I feel that they press too hard. second time I went back to them, I told the woman you're pressing too hard and hurting me.  Also, if the RX says three things, they may give you two and add something different. Fine, if it works.Generally, they're very friendly and make you feel like a person and not a commodity. I've seen several of these theory places come and go and the ones that go probably valued their bottom line over the patient. Great parking at the Macon location and you only have a few steps to walk to get to the door. I've always felt comfortable there and well treated.  Never ever walked in the door and not greeted with an attitude of ""glad to see you."""
179,MED_38,I was very concerned about coming here due to the distance from my house and the ONE bad review for this place. I tried to get another therapy place closer to my house .. However .. This was it .. One .. Yes .. Only one.. covered by my Insurance. ( Sigh) Well it turns out they are not too bad. Nice people and clean environment. My one complaint is that they hardly changed my routine and then cut me loose to go back to work without asking me what I need to do and did no work conditioning.. I was not ready.
180,MED_38,"Probably the worst physical therapy office I've ever been to. Only accept cash & personal checks and will not bill the patient if they don't have cash or a check?? It's 20 freakin '19 for crying out loud. That's just the start of the terrible business this is. The receptionists are nice, but claim that the owner doesn't want to change policies that help/benefit the patients. Just like other reviews have mentioned, the therapists and equipment are out of date. All they do is give you the exercises that are literally internet prinouts and do some icing. If your insurance allows find another one because it's almost better to save your money and find the rehab exercises online. Why can't a business actually be in the business of helping the patients instead of squeezing every possible dime out of their patients and giving them the least possible service. It's disgraceful."
181,MED_38,"True the parking sucks here. True they only accept cash for payment on co-pays. True they are always busy. However the are here to teach you how to excercise and which therapys work best in what order. You have to actually put in the work of doing the excercise and tharapies to get good results. Then you come back for a check up on your progress. If you did your homework, they might give you another level to work on. The Therapists and Therapy Aides are friendly, professional and competent. They work with you and your legitimate limits and help you improve your health by correcting your moves & methods. They also suggested other things to discuss with my Doctor for improving my progress in therapy. That suggests an interest in my health improvement. They are not just going through the motions. If it wasn't for the busy schedule, crowded parking and cash only policy I'd give them a top star review."
182,MED_38,"Don't go here! First the parking garage is a disaster to park in. Second the fact they don't take credit/debit cards is really inconvenient. Both appointments I went to they were behind schedule. This is a small facility and they cram so many patients in at the same time. Not to mention the equipment is really out dated, the bike looks like its over 20yrs old & was bought at a yard sale. Now I could've overlooked all those things if they had great therapists that really helped, but they don't. I told the therapists multiple times that because I am hyper-mobile I need help with my stretching and they ignored me. I told them the stretches/exercises are not hitting the right area of my neck and they told me just to keep doing them. If you need hands on work to help you heal, go somewhere else, they won't touch you to help work out knots. I tried calling them 3 times to cancel my appointments and the phone rings & rings & then goes silent. Horrible!"
183,MED_41,Incredible care for adults and little ones alike. My daughter was right at home here. Kind and knowledgeable staff. And.... they accept Premera
184,MED_41,"What can I say, the reviews on Dr. Chrissy were correct. She is amazing. Throughout my entire first appointment she was so kind and empathetic to my pain and the emotion that comes with a first pregnancy. She addressed all my concerns including health questions. After my first adjustment, I already feel a million times better. Thank you!! I cant wait to go back, I know this is exactly what me and my baby need!!"
185,MED_41,"I have been seeing Dr. Justin since my car accident in April. He's been super knowledgeable and helpful in my recovery and overall health. He has guided me to getting the resources I need and I can tell he loves what he does. I love that he takes the time with you to really get to know you, rather than ticking another patient off the list so to speak. When Dr. Justin and Maurice (front office manager- she's so awesome!) were both gone one day, I could tell they really communicated my treatment plan to Dr. Chrissy and office staff. That type of communication and attention to detail are the things I look for in a health care facility. Although I've only met with Dr. Chrissy once, we had a wonderful conversation about a Paleo lifestyle and diet. She's great! definitely recommend this office for not only, chiropractic care, but overall health and wellness."
186,MED_41,"This is the first chiropractor I've ever been to and have been pretty happy with my results over the last couple months. When I first came in I had 2 separate, chronic back pain issues and no idea what to expect. I was impressed when my first appointment was an hour long and at least the first 40 minutes were spent just discussing my history and symptoms. Dr. Justin asked about things I never would have known could be related -- he was very thorough, listened intently, and seemed very knowledgable. He ordered X-rays of my back, which provided a lot of great insight into my pain. He spent a lot of time showing me the imagines and explaining what he saw. Going in, my only impression of chiropractors was this idea that you go in, lay on a table and a doctor cracks your back in a bunch of crazy ways and sends you on your way, cured. (Ta-da!) Of course I learned that it's a bit more involved than that, namely in that you should expect to be asked to come back in on at least a weekly basis when you first begin treatment. It takes several visits to establish a good baseline of correcting whatever issues you may have going on-- something I wasn't expecting, so initially I was taken aback by that. When my pain started dissolving though, I knew we were on the right track! Justin has used multiple methods to adjust me, all new to me and all impressive! I feel better after every appointment. 1 of my 2 issues cleared up completely after 3 or 4 visits and the other has improved greatly!I was a little confused about what ""the plan"" was during the beginning stages of treatment but it's coming together now. Also seem to be having lots of issues with my insurance/payment process but that could be on the insurance company and not on Fife Chiropractic. Overall it's been a great experience so far!"
187,MED_41,"Hi, my name is Daniel and I'm 2! Doctor Chrissy and Justin were making me feel better and better every day. I felt like I was their favorite patient and they actually said I was!Me, and my mommy and daddy are happy to say that Fife Chiropractic is the best and fun office to be at. I hope Dr. Justin remembers me so that my mommy can get a free massage. Thank you :)"
188,MED_41,I've been going here for a few months and I absolutely love them. The staff is incredible and the doctors are top notch!! You can really tell that they genuinely care about your well being which makes for a great visit every time. If you're in pain or just looking to better your health definitely give them a try!
189,MED_41,"The BEST Drs and staff around! If you have a kink, a bend or just needed an alignment...stop in here. Dr Chrissy & Dr Justin are top of the line, compassionate and caring and LISTEN to their patients!"
190,MED_44,I really couldn't say enough good things a butt my outpatient visit to this hospital and the staff working there. Everyone I dealt with was nice and helpful. As for hospitals I would definitely give them another try if the med arose!
191,MED_44,"Decided to come here instead of St. Joseph. Usual 5 hour stay for an ER visit. Had a long wait and confusion getting a ct scan. Misunderstanding on the quality of the I.V.. Finally decided it was working the entire time. Doctors were thorough and approachable. This trip was an extra 15 minutes for us but since it was covered by Insurance decided to try it. Overall, I would say they are pretty even maybe a slight tip to St. Joseph's due to the friendliness of the nurses in the E.R.."
192,MED_45,"From my initial scheduling process with Jasmine to now several months of Sarah's PT plan (I had a serious foot and ankle injury) they have been spectacular. I've gained back a surprising amount of range of motion given the injury, and regained the ability to walk with a normal-looking gait (it'll never be actually normal again due to the realities of the injury). If you need PT in Savannah and are willing to put in work to get better, I highly recommend them."
193,MED_45,"I really cannot say enough good things about Sarah, Jasmine and my experience at Benchmark. I went in with hip pain that had been nagging me for months and came from a several year-old running injury. I was told by the doctor I could get a cortisone shot or try physical therapy and since I am not a fan of shots or temporary fix's I opted for the physical therapy. Sarah was a lot of fun to work with and always seemed to have a great attitude about being at work. Jasmine was always a pleasure to speak to over the phone and in person setting up appointments. This was the first time I used physical therapy in a long time and I felt the facility was modern and had the equipment needed for me to work on improving my hip. While there Sarah also gave me some exercises to work on my lower back pain and was always very flexible on appointment times. In short, my injury got better and I had fun doing it. This location was also convenient to my house; I would recommend this Benchmark office to anyone needing these services. Also, to show the dedication Sarah has, she participated in a 10k race as a fund raiser as part of their corporate fundraising process (for American Heart Association if I recall). I would be remis if I did not mention that Sarah does dry needling, if you don't know what that is be sure to ask her as she is happy to show you!"
194,MED_48,"Warning: They are owned by Wellstar Hospital and appointments are billed as such, so your insurance will evaluate the claim as a hospital visit. In my situation this resulted in having to pay $75 to $225 per visit instead of a $50 copay each time. They have no problem encouraging a greater number of appointments because ""you'll meet your deductible sooner rather than later"". Other than that issue, I think PT Solutions is a good provider. Staff was friendly and you get a good amount of attention despite them juggling multiple patients at a time. That being said, if you want undivided attention I would not recommend going here unless you only make appointments during the slower hours. Office was very nice with a lot of great equipment. I do feel they helped with my neck issues but I will not be returning due to their billing practices."
195,MED_49,"In 2016 my mother fell at Fair Oaks Mall and broke a bone directly under her shoulder. There was very little the Doctors could do to help her, so they sent her home with a sling around her arm and a bottle of pain pills. Fortunately for my mom, I knew a great Physical Therapist who helped me in 2011 after fracturing several vertebrae in a car accident. That physical therapist was David Sahley, the owner/operator of Dynamics Physical Therapy. My mom was skeptical and a little scared of going to Physical Therapy because she didn't know much about it. But, because I recommend Dynamics she trusted me and made an appointment to specifically see David Sahley. After meeting with Dr. Dave just once, her perspective completely changed due to Dr. Dave's expertise, trustworthiness, and positive attitude which created an immediate bond between Dave and my mom. Before my mom started PT with Dynamics she wasn't even able to lift her arm above shoulder-level. This meant she couldn't drive, do her hair, or even get dressed without extreme difficulty. Once she started going to see Dave, her condition improved dramatically from one appointment to the next. In just three weeks time, my mom regained the ability to drive, do her hair, and get dressed without any difficulty. The progress she made in just three weeks was astonishing, but Dr. Dave wasn't going to let her off quite that easily. Dr. Dave stressed the importance of continuing her therapy to insure that her condition would not regress, and that another few weeks of therapy would reinforce and solidify the progress she had made. So my mom continued her therapy for another 3-4 weeks, both in the Dynamics' office and at home, and the extra work paid off perfectly. To this day, my mom has total mobility in her arm/shoulder and has no pain whatsoever, all thanks to David Sahley and Dynamics Physical Therapy. It's as if she was never even injured. In summary, I highly recommend Dynamics Physical Therapy and David Sahley as a best-in-class Doctor of Physical Therapy. Dr. Dave's expertise, experience, and record of success speaks for itself and is second to none. But what truly sets him apart from other PT's is his empathy, kindness, and tremendous sense of humor which sets his patient's minds at ease. If I can trust Dr. Dave with the health and well-being of my own mother, I can trust him to care for anyone and everyone. Thank you Dr. Dave!"
196,MED_49,"Went for initial assessment - The Physician, (Karen) was very thorough and was able to get a little bit of therapy in as well. Feel better after day 1. Scheduling was already set up but was able to work with them very easily to remove appointments that conflicted with my work schedule. Didn't add and that might have been a problem. Haven't seen any billing yet but expecting it to be as any therapy would be. It's a co pay every visit so shouldn't be any surprise such as ""Test T."" described. Maybe it's new for them. We didn't discuss any payments so that may be an area for improvement especially for someone who may be new to therapy. A good discussion and heads up might have helped ""Test T."" be prepared."
197,MED_49,"This practice supported my daughter and helped her recover and rehabilitate from various injuries throughout her competitive gymnastics career...for six+ years, from middle school into college. Dr. Sahley is not only a highly competent and outstanding physical therapist, but his personality and relaxed demeanor make him someone that patients of all ages can easily relate to and communicate with. Smart and intuitive, Dr. Sahley stands out in his field technically because he is also certified as an orthopedic manual therapist (as is his colleague, Dr. Jensen-Vick). I believe several times my daughter's outcomes were more successful because Dr. Sahley was able to integrate manual therapy into her treatment. Although the Herndon office may be small and rather close-quartered, the staff and therapists loom very large in my book!"
198,MED_52,"I ran a lot in my younger days, but due to less than ideal ankles and my leg's pre-disposition to heavy stress (genuvalgum), I ran to the point of where it hurt enough for my jaws to clench simply walking across campus or going down the stairs. No one really knew what was going on, but the doctors told me to either seek physical therapy or orthopaedics if necessary. I didn't have the time to go physical therapy, and orthopaedics seemed daunting. With no way of understanding what was going on, I stopped running. I gained 15 pounds my first year and 10 more the second year...I mentioned that I wanted to run again to my current doctors at Kaiser (they are fantasic!), who figured out what I had and sent me off to physical therapy.I chose this place since it's close to me, and love the staff here. My treatment for PFS (runner's knee) included several different exercises to build strength, as well as a sonic deep tissue ""treatment"". Appointments shouldn't last more than 30-40minutes, and the staff here are very friendly and accommodating. The road to healing was pretty long, but I can now actually run for more than 5 minutes without that awful, resonating pain in my knees. I really want to thank PA. I recently experienced that runner's high again for the first time in two years (runners, you know what I'm talking about). I am so thankful for the advice they've given and work they've done on me."
199,MED_52,"Good variety of equipment that they keep clean . They know how to ""create "" things that work! Example two tennis balls taped strategically apart to massage my neck . Worked perfectly! Dylan and Katlin worked well together and know the meaning of team work! Bonus their therapy actually makes a difference in both my torn meniscus and rotator cuff"
200,MED_52,"I have been going to Caitlyn for the past 4 months to address ongoing neck issues that I have battled on and off for over 20 years. Right as I started PT, I fell and broke my ankle, so we had to add therapy for my ankle as well. Caitlyn was simply amazing! She's very knowledgeable, kind and patient. Highly recommend.My husband also goes to PT and sees Dylan. Everything I said about Caitlyn applies to Dylan as well!"
201,MED_52,I've been going here with injuries resulting a accident. My PT is Danielle and she's so sweet. She has another person that she helps whenever I'm there. I've never had PT so I am not sure if that is the norm. The staff here is friendly and informative.
202,MED_52,"I want to thank Dylan, Caitlin, Rachel and Rod for being so kind to me during my time at Physiotherapy Associates. I had physical therapy as the result of a car accident. My lower back, left shoulder and arm were really in pain and I could barely turn my head to the left.  It was a really scary time. Dylan and Caitlin were friendly, caring, patient and knowledgable. During each visit Dylan and Caitlin took me through various exercises and explained how they would help. They also used various techniques to bring me relief, i.e tens unit, massage and dry needling. When one thing didn't work we went on to the next thing. Dry needling hurts initially, but it was effective. They gave me exercises to do at home and showed me how to do them to make sure I did them correctly while on my own. Thank you again to Dylan, Caitlin and the entire staff."
203,MED_52,I received fantastic treatment at Physio for a nagging shoulder injury. The staff genuinely care about their patients and provide detailed explanation along with excellent care and at-home exercises. Highly recommended for any PT needs!
204,MED_52,"Physical therapy was okay, but the billing is a nightmare. My therapy was not covered by insurance so I paid the amount the company indicated for each visit out of pocket before each session. I was never given any indication that I was not paying the full amount for the attention I received. However, months later I received a statement showing additional charges added to almost all of my visits and a balance now due. I tried to call the company to get an explanation for the charges but could never reach a live person. My only option was to leave a message that was never returned. Then, every few days or so, I would receive a robocall from the company. When I answered I would be put on hold for up to ten minutes then disconnected without a live person ever getting on the line. This happened dozens of times. I was never able to speak to a live person and the extraneous charges were never explained. Take your business elsewhere. PA is just in the business of billing, not helping you get well."
205,MED_52,"I had nothing but positive experiences with everyone who worked there, from the front desk to the doctor, everyone was wonderful! Personalized treatment by people who actually cared. Highly recommended and will go back again!"
206,MED_52,Disclaimer :This update has nothing to do with the staff or doctors. My main complaint is with the business operations and billing process here. I got charge incorrectly on one of my visit and I've been trying to resolve the issue for the last couple of months with no success. It is very frustrating and I don't want others to have to go through the same pain. Please make sure to review your statements and ask questions immediately.
207,MED_52,"Dylan and Tim are friendly, caring, professional and knowledgeable. They took great care of me. I highly recommend this facility and staff!"
208,MED_52,"Nader Alhooie, DPT has been treating my lower back injury (L4, 5, S1) Piriformis Syndrome, & IT band pain since April. I don't know what I would have done without his expertise, amazing bedside manner, and clay heat packs! I highly recommend this location for all your ailments, especially when you're dealing with any debilitation...each of the staff members are super nice, and the clean facilities with amazing tree line views are just what you'll need to get back up and at 'em! I'll actually miss going here now that I'm better!!!"
209,MED_52,"Great place for PT and super friendly and assistive staff! They always work with your schedule and let you know if your therapist is going to be out and you need to reschedule. The front desk staff, Holly and Malorie, are always so nice and patient and assist you with any questions or needs you have. I had therapy with Dylan who is just the best!!! I had been dealing with plantar fasciitis for years and doing doctor prescribed stretching and icing with no results. I asked my doctor to try ""dry needling"" and from the very first session it provided immediate refief. Over the course of treatment it has completely changed my life. The dry needling is a little ""uncomfortable"" compared to other treatment options but nothing compared to my daily pain and it is nothing compared to the severe option of surgery. I can't thank Dylan and Phsio enough for the relief and change in my feet and my life. I would recommend anyone trying dry needling if it is an option for their condition. It is a serious ""no knife/no drugs"" way to go. Thanks Dylan!"
210,MED_52,"I work for the City of Atlanta Police Department and recently got injured while at work. I pulled my intercostal muscle and trapezius muscle which eventually put a very painful strain on the muscles in my shoulder. At one point my muscles were strained so bad, I had trouble breathing. I was hesitant about physical therapy because I had never done it before and haven't heard all positives things from friends and family. But to my surprise I was thoroughly pleased with each visit. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Both the physical therapist (Dylan) and his assistant (Tim) provided my with at home exercises to strengthen my shoulder after each session. I went to physically therapy for about two months and now feel 100% better. I would definitely recommend the needle therapy if you have muscle spasms like I was having (don't worry it's not painful). The office and equipment are all clean and well kept as well. The billing process was very easy for me as well. I just paid with a card at the end of each session."
211,MED_54,"First time visit went great! Rosie at the front desk is very helpful and so nice! Made me feel comfortable and less stressed! The doctor, I believe her name was Kristin or something along those lines was very sweet she kept my mind distracted while doing a exam and she was very quick and gentle. Overall great experience"
212,MED_54,"Great nurse practitioners! They are practically your doctor from day one. Veronica was awesome! The wait is always a minimum of 15-20min. I've waited half an hour on several occasions. Once you get to the back room there's another minimum wait of 10minutes. The front desk staff aren't consistent with their customer service and attitudes. Some days they seem nice and others they seem short and impatient. When you call to ask questions, they aren't very warm and don't seem thrilled to help you out. The only person that seemed consistent every time I called was Rosie out of the whole 9 months she was always nice.  I saw my doctor maybe 3 times throughout my whole pregnancy. I can tell Kroeker is great at what she does but it sucks to feel like you're just a number. They seem to be very busy. You come in, wait for a long time, get Seen for what you need quickly, and get out. Quick quick quick, go go go. For my first pregnancy I was hoping for more of a warm comforting experience where I felt like my doctor really got to know me and my baby over the 9 months of checkups. If you don't care that the environment is a little cold and not so personal or one on one with your doctor then I think it's a pretty good office. The technology and equipment are up to date. They seem to run things very strict and structured. It's organized for sure just very busy. There doesn't seem to be room for birth plans or getting to know your doctor personally throughout your pregnancy. You will get to know your nurse practitioner well. I never saw my doctor when I delivered at the hospital or after having my baby at my 6 week checkup, I just felt like another number throughout the whole process not really a valued patient. They get you in and they get you out. It's not a bad place though. It's clean and everything runs pretty smoothly. I would give 4 starts but due to the long waits, inconsistent customer service, and feeling like I was just a number, I give it 3 stars. Maybe others will have a better experience."
213,MED_54,"I had an appt today my very first visit and I was very disappointed. The office is so nice, the lady at the front desk was super nice but never once made eye contact with me she was rushing to get me signed in and once I got called to the back was even worse the MA was so unprofessional she was asking about another patients chart shouting that patients information out loud while walking me into the room . Inside of the room she basically told me I didn't know what medication I took only because she didn't know how to spell it she made faces while typing it in she asked me questions and wouldn't even wait for me to answer by then I was over it then came walking in the nurse she just seemed annoyed that I was there didn't smile once and I just felt judged my whole visit walking out she basically threw my packet at me and went on about her day nobody greets patients I will never return to this office as I work for a very high maintenance fast pace office and never once was our customer service skills ever questioned because no matter how long our day has been we treat all of our patients with respect and try to make them comfortable coming to the doctor"
214,MED_54,"I had many issues while being in the care of Marine, the PA, throughout my pregnancy. If you get her as a provider, please read through my review. The office staff was professional and helpful, and I always experienced reasonable wait times. Dr. Kroeker is also smart and ultimately put me on a good plan of action when I ended up in the hospital after my 32 week ultrasound due to preeclampsia and my baby having IUGR.However, I don't feel Marine was equipped to handle my pregnancy. She told me that she was going to schedule my gestational diabetes test at my next appointment. Then at my next appointment, she got annoyed and said I only have a week to take the test. She asked why I hadn't done it yet, and I said I was told I would get the order at the current appointment. She asked who told me this. I said, ""You."" She said, ""Oh."" With no apology for trying to scold me. My husband who is a doctor asked me to bring up my snoring and pauses in breathing when I slept while pregnant. He said there is research linking preeclampsia and snoring. I brought it up to Marine and she said it is normal. She said by the time I get a sleep study done, I would have given birth. Did I mention I got preeclampsia...I see sleep specialist Dr. Keenan now, and she said there is a link and she said her office works to try to get pregnant women in the clinic within a week. She was disappointed to hear what happened. My MAIN issue was she did not see my low platelets and positive antibody test in the first trimester as a red flag. She was confused by the new electronic medical record system, and ordered me a slimmed down blood test during the middle of my pregnancy. I heard the medical assistant tell her at the counter that she ordered the wrong test for me. I approached Marine and asked if I need a different order for my blood draw. She told me no and to use the one she gave me. Ended up that the test did not catch everything that was going on. The test did come up again with the antibody, and I asked her if I needed to take further blood tests. She said it was up to me. WTF?Ultimately I switched to Kathy the NP. When more warning signs came up, Kathy consulted Dr. Kroeker and she told me to check in to Clovis Community right away. Ended up with an emergency C section at 32 weeks and my baby had to be in the CRMC NICU for a month. I can't say for sure what caused all my problems. But it made me angry how Marine's ego got in the way of giving me complete and attentive care during my pregnancy. If I had stayed with Marine, I personally don't think she would have elevated my case to Dr. Kroeker. If you get her as a provider during pregnancy, please consider switching."
215,MED_54,"This place is awful!!!! I've had such a hard time here. I am suppose to be covered for all BC options at 100% through my medical insurance. This place is trying to charge me for it and I have relayed to them that they are using the wrong coding for my insurance over and over again and they do not correct it. After five months, they finally said they would change the coding however I am here today with debt collectors mailing me a bill! This is money that I should not owe at all to them and they do not care. They don't contact your insurance company or try to fix billing issues and have the worst customer service. Because of this, they deserve no stars. I could care less if the doctor is good if I have to deal with all of this to get there. Sorry but there's a million good doctors."
216,MED_54,"Marine was the last Dr to see me before delivering a full-term 38 week stillbirth just 2 days later. This was in 2009. I remember specifically that she struggled to read and take note of my babies heart rate and she seemed rushed. It was just a few days before Christmas. It was my first and last time seeing Marine. I should have been sent to have an NST. It was my first baby and admittedly I knew nothing about counting kicks or the fact that even today women have stillborn babies due to cord accidents and cord knots. My sweet baby died in my sleep 2 nights later due to an umbilical cord knot that they believe tightened when the baby dropped, or possibly from her moving around. It's very likely that her distress would have shown up on NST days and even weeks before. I saw Dawn most of my pregnancy for just about every appointment. I lost over 20 pounds in my first 3 months of pregnancy. Looking back, I should have been hospitalized! I had violent morning sickness. I couldn't hold anything down and would have benefited from an IV. I became so dehydrated. I had an already healthy thin frame and at 5 months pregnant was barely showing at all because I lost so much weight. Being my first pregnancy I think I expected more guidance and I wasn't my own advocate and didn't ask enough questions. I delivered my baby girl stillborn on Christmas Eve of 2009. I was too sad to ever try to retaliate or confront the office about my suspicions. I moved on to a new office and had 2 successful subsequent pregnancies."
217,MED_54,"I transferred to Dr. Kroeker's office after moving to the area because I was pregnant, which was also high risk. They referred me to and consulted with a high risk OB without difficulty. My NP has been Veronica and she is very kind and caring. Dr. Kroeker has also been wonderful to work with and performed my c-section. The wait time is very reasonable and the office staff is really nice. I recommend Dr. Kroeker's office based on my great experience there."
218,MED_54,"I have been seen by this practice for over 8 years. I have been seen by them throughout 3 pregnancies and annual check ups. I have always felt treated with respect and cared for. I see mostly Dawn and Dr Kroeker, but I was lucky enough to have Dr. Peters and Dr Kroeker preform my second C-Section. I have a minuscule scar and have had no issues."
219,MED_54,"I transferred to Dr. Kroeker at 10 weeks pregnant with my twins and had the Dawn at my first visit, avoid her if possible. She judged me based off my age and infertility that I was so young to be on clomid (24) After that I continuously saw Dr Kroeker and Peters as I refused to see Dawn. Staff is great minus the rude encounter on my first day, wait time is about 15mins. Once you're in the back it goes quickly. Prior to being Kroeker's patient I didn't even know if I wanted more kids due to a bad c section experience and was going to tie my tubes. Last minute I decided not to and I'm glad I didn't, her and her father delivered my twins & I had an amazing experience."
220,MED_54,My visit was quick comfortable and satisfying. The girls all are amazing made me feel so welcome&dr was very gentle and answered all my questions honestly and with care.
221,MED_54,"I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy. The way I was treated in an already-tough situation was inappropriate, unprofessional, and heartless. I hope communication strategies and practices improve for future patients."
222,MED_54,"I was recommended to this practice but after 2 appointments, I transferred back to my old gynecologist. On my first appt there, Marine was kind and polite. She explained all my options to me and together we agreed on what to do. She said that in three months, if the problem has not been solved (I was having a full on period every 2 weeks and then heavy spotting in between those two weeks, requiring the use of a menstrual cup), to come back in and they would to an ultrasound to check if there is a cyst, fibroid, or some other reason for the bleeding. After 3 months with no change, I went back. At this appt, she acted completely different. Was short tempered, wouldn't let me finish speaking, and rude. When I told her I would like to do the ultrasound (which she recommended at that first appt) she said that since I am having no abdominal pain, there is no point in an ultrasound. (And btw, it is possible to have a fibroid or another problem without having pain.) I told her that the problem has not gotten solved and she replied with, ""well, it's not like I have a magical wand that can solve all your problems."" To which I let her know that I didn't want a magical wand, I wanted the ultrasound or other testing done. She refused and prescribed another type of birth control, which guess what? After 4 months, it still hasn't gotten any better."
223,MED_54,I started out with Dr Peters and have transitioned to seeing Dawn.  Love them both and the staff is always so patient and nice....
224,MED_54,"I hate to give this practice a one star rating, but after my last appointment I have to. When I first chose this practice they had a 4.7 star rating, and now they have a 3.9. There is a reason. The first time I went I felt like I was appreciated, and the doctor took the time to hear out my concerns. My recent visit was with Marine, and it was awful, even the tech wasn't pleasant. I came to the doctor's office for a second opinion on a breast lump. I was told before it was just hardened breast tissue, but over the last 2 years the tenderness of it was getting worrisome. I explained my concerned, and she examined me. She couldn't even find it until I pointed it out, and she instantly said it was hard breast tissue. I wanted an ultrasound, not a doctor with a hunch. She said I didn't need it. This was my body, my insurance, and my money. If I want one, I want one. There are so many cases of doctors not listening to patients or thinking a lump is not suspicious, and that patient dies of cancer. I did not want to be another statistic. I honestly felt like I was being talked down upon my entire appointment, and I was made to feel like what I was feeling was irrelevant. I would NOT recommend this practice just because you might end up with her. The other doctors are amazing and welcoming. Save yourself the trouble."
225,MED_54,"The wait time is good. Dr. kroeker is great. Her father, dr. Peters should be retired by now because it's hard to communicate with him when he can't hear very well. Try to avoid the PA, Marina. She is not very nice and gets annoyed easily when you ask her questions, which is the last thing we need as a first time pregnant woman. We need a doctor who is willing to listen, sensitive to our concerns and reassuring- not a provider that puts us down and tell us to use our common sense."
226,MED_55,"Rebalansing Health is beyond exceptional. I have been to numerous physical therapists and none have come close to the treatment, personalized care and results I attained at this clinic. One-on-One sessions with hands on care, gave me results that allowed me to start enjoying life again after being bed ridden for a good period of time."
227,MED_55,"Oren Bar is AS GOOD AS IT GETS when it comes to his physical therapy treatments. He is not your run of the mill PT who leaves you to do exercises while he helps 3 other people. He is one on one the entire time he is with you and does so many things that are more related to the mind-body connection rather than just physical therapy. His training is completely different than most physical therapists that I have met. My only concern is that he does not take any insurance, and I had to pay out of pocket each time. Even so, I do feel that he was worth his fees. I will say that he helped me immensely, and I would recommend him to EVERYONE!"
228,MED_57,"5+ STARSI am so thankful to had found such a wonderful place as this. Moving from the NYC area to Cleveland definitely put a toll on my lower back and sciatica. David knew right how to help. Within the first few visits, the proper assessments were given with beyond thoughtfulness and care.After some discussion also about how to increase my trunk (core+back) strength, I feel I am on a wonderful path to healing. Thank you. Not only is David an accomplished and knowledgeable doctor of physical therapy, he is a wealth of information regarding the rich traditions found in Slovenian-style Polka. As a music professor myself, I am thankful also for this knowledge. He knows how to connect with his patients on a professional level and I look forward to future treatments under his care at ReForm."
229,MED_57,"I came through Cleveland on tour and got the BEST care from Jen, one of the owners. She took the time to actually listen to my concerns and needs and didn't treat me as a cookie cutter patient. They use many different modalities and are constantly learning more to better the care the patient receives. I would highly recommend this office to anybody, whether it be to the most physical extreme athlete or to an everyday lay person."
230,MED_57,"I have recently moved to Cleveland and always wanted to try a reform Pilates class. ReForm is amazing and I highly recommend it for anyone wanting a great workout, and uniquely fun and different from the norm."
231,MED_57,"When I first came across Relevation I was drawn to the idea of a different type of workout but admittedly intimidated by the equipment and memories of the one Pilates class I had attended years earlier which was filled with women who were doing things I couldn't imagine being able to do. I never went back to that class, but am so pleased that I gave Relevation a try. After just a month or two of a modest combination of Pilates mat, Reformer (scary looking machines that are actually fun and challenging in all good ways), and TRX, I have noticed a big change in my core strength and flexibility. I love the studio for its small class size and the fact that Jen and David, in addition to being fun, patient, and challenging instructors, both hold PhD degrees in Physical Therapy, which means that when my shoulder ""feels off"" they can immediately help me make an adjustment to keep my workout on track while keeping everything in good shape. Among the best workouts I've had. Highly recommended."
232,MED_57,"After months of physical therapy, chiropractic and acupuncture sessions, I finally found Relevation. Before setting up my appointment, I emailed Jen to give her some background information, and she quickly emailed me back giving me reassurance she could help. After my first appointment, I felt like there was hope again. Both Jen and David truly care about your pain, they listen to every concern and give you their undivided attention. Not to mention, they have so many tricks up their sleeves to help manage any injuries you might have (i.e. dry needling, KT tape, strength training, stretching, Pilates reformer, etc.). Other added pluses are that the facility is warm, welcoming and private. I would highly recommended Relevation!"
233,MED_58,"Dr. Eric and Dr. Meeks were very professional and I feel great every time I leave their office. The overall staff is always very friendly and my appointments are prompt, which is good with my busy schedule!I would highly recommend to anyone looking for chiropractic care in the Cleveland area."
234,MED_58,"Meh. Not great. $150 for initial visit which included a lot of interview and waiting. The place seemed dirty and felt like a warehouse. There were temporary walls put up to block visually but nothing to block the sound of other chatty patients. There was a guy with a voice like Roseanne Bar's husband Dan. I could here him the whole time. I could tell you his life story. He works third shift, likes to take his Addrroll in the afternoon and his ambiance when he gets off work. Bla bla bla. He was soooo loud. They put me through a super long interview and then put me in a room to do stem on but on such a low power that I couldn't feel it, even after I asked her to turn it up the voltage. Plus the massage table looked dirty. There were oil and lotion marks on the table meaning they don't clean between clients. Then the chiropractor saw me for 1 minute and only adjusted one spot. The massage therapist was nice but it was short. What a waste of time, money, and life."
235,MED_58,great practice and great staff. They truly care about patients and take your care seriously. Dr Ty is a great chiropractor and they have various medical staff as well. They are great at what they do and they took care of my back with adjustments as well as therapy.
236,MED_58,"EXCELLENT. I tried a number of places in Cleveland before finding AHC. I have now been going regularly for years - every time I injure myself. I use and have used their chiropractic, massage and physio staff, all of whom are really, really good at what they do.  Wonderful staff, great service, very effective. They have a number of people in every position, making sure that there is variety and breadth of expertise. THE BEST FACILITY IN CLEVELAND, and probably the best I've used in any of the cities I have lived in."
237,MED_58,"I am sorry to say that I was not very impressed with the care I received at AHC. I went in for a sports injury that I expected would require some PT. I ended up working with a Nurse Practitioner and the Physical Therapist. Both of these women were not who is listed under ""Staff"" on their website. I know it's a little thing, but I like to be able to do some background research on the people treating me before I go to my appointment. So it was just surprising to be seen by new people. Why are these people not on their website?Everyone was very ""nice,"" but I felt rushed in both of my appointments and did not get the sense that anybody wanted to really focus on my specific issue and the background behind my injury. My experience with the Nurse Practitioner was fine, but nothing special. But my experience with the PT was truly underwhelming. First, I get there at 5:15 for a 5:30 appointment. I didn't get called back until around 5:45. And when the PT comes to bring me back for my appointment, she says ""I hear you're having some low back issues!"" However, I don't have any low back issues; I have anterior hip pain! Then she is taking notes on her computer when I am describing my issue and pain points when her computer dies. She then says ""my computer died. But no problem, it's not important."" If it's not important, why are you taking notes in the first place? And maybe it is important so you'll actually know what my issue is for my next appointment. Around 6PM, the PT told me that I just bruised my hip joint. But there was no explanation why a strong, healthy 25 year old is bruising is hip joint and why we could induce pain unweighted, etc. She just told me to ""stretch"" and gave a basic hamstring stretch. When I asked about stability exercises, her immediate response at 6:02PM was ""I will show you some, but just so you know, we close at 6. But I will let stay a little late this time."" However, I got there at 5:15 and wasn't called back until 5:45! I believe I should be entitled to my full allotment of time, and didn't appreciate her being in such a rush to leave--especially considering it was they who were running late.Also, their hours are not super convenient. The latest they are open is 6PM, which is not super helpful if you work to 5:30. This is only a small complaint compared to the quality of care received, but it is still something that could be improved. I wanted to enjoy my experience at AHC, but I was just underwhelmed and disappointed. I went somewhere else, and the experience was night and day."
238,MED_58,"Been to several chiropractors and by far the best to date. Treatment of stim, adjustment, and massage every visit has my pain and discomfort virtually gone. Staff is friendly, visits are on time and efficient. I won't be going anywhere else anytime soon."
239,MED_58,"This place is horrible. At first the treatment is great, but after about 2 weeks it starts to turn. This staff and company puts themselves before the patients. Don't have a patient do almost 2 hours of therapy and then not get a massage like they are supposed to do. Its not our problem that the company or staff decides to over book. I requested my medical records from them a week in a half in advance so i could follow up with my orthopedic. Of course that didn't happen. Oh and not to mention that you go there for therapy and they don't even send your final results to the doctor. They just say your done and follow up with your doctor if your still in pain. What kind of crap is that????!!! So im here at my orthopedic appointment and have no results for my therapy. I asked them to send them now please, which its 9:40 am on a Tuesday. They said they can't until tomorrow. Really??? You cant take 5 mins of your time to fax your records? I will NEVER go back here nor will i ever recommend it so someone. They just opened and i feel they need to be closed. Just horrible, they do it for the money not the patient."
240,MED_58,"Rude staff. They lost my paperwork and then required me to jump through hoops for my visit, requiring a doctor release although I prior treatment with their office. I left having wasted my time."
241,MED_58,"Not only do I go to AHC for regular maintenance, but so do many of our athletes at CrossFit Sixth City and Cleveland Strength and Conditioning. We regularly utilize their awesome chiropractors, massage therapists and PT for maintenance, injuries and health evaluations and screenings for ourselves and our athletes. I also look forward to working with the new ART specialist. There is many places I personally trust with my health and wellness. AHC won't let you down."
242,MED_58,"First I want to say the actual physical massage was great - 4 stars there!! However....I went here on a Groupon for a 60-minute deep tissue massage. The hours here are quite strict and do not include weekends! This makes calling and obtaining an appointment difficult. I finally requested an appointment online and a friendly receptionist called me back a few days later. Subsequent calls on the day of my appointment to see if I could move it up earlier and again for directions were answered promptly and in a friendly manner. Even though I called about being seen early I was actually seen....you guessed it! Late! I would have rather been told 'no I couldn't be seen early' than be told to come early and then not even be seen at my initial appointment time!! The receptionist even left talking on her mobile while I will still waiting. The office is inside the main building of Lutheran Hospital. Go in the main doors. Right. Find the elevator in the far right corner. Go to floor ""1"". Find suite 1000 - A+ for signage to the suite. They have a one person (not spotlessly clean) bathroom in their office but have no keys to the restroom down the hall. The office was old: carpeting, waiting room chairs, etc... The quality of the massage was great, however it was done in a room with two overhead florescent lights so not very peaceful. And the breath of the lady working on me was a mixture of smoke/mint gum. Gross. And when it was time to lie face down the face cradle was covered in several crinkly and rough bathroom paper towels instead of a soft maybe even warmed towel. All in all I won't be back - I can get just as good a massage elsewhere plus a good environment."
243,MED_58,I had a terrible pain in the back of my neck and that extended down to my back which both were causing a headache. This had been going on for 2 weeks so I was in need of a chiropractor. I did a Yelp and Google search and found Allied Health and saw they were close to my office. I got in that same day when I called and Dr.Ty took care f my issue. The entire staff was friendly and knowledgeable about my issue and identified what I had going on. Highly recommend this place
244,MED_58,"The people in the office were all very nice and helpful, however, I was unspeakably disappointed with the massage I received, especially since someone I know told me to go here. I'm so confused. I was very specific with what I needed done--I came to get a massage that would help alleviate low back and knee pain, not a massage for pleasure--and continued to try and communicate that the pressure was not enough. And when she did give me more pressure, it was strange and not at all logical. She also didn't get to the two main areas I explicitly said were giving me trouble. I assumed she was going to get to both sides, but instead she spent all her time on my shoulders (probably because that's easier than the QL, piriformis, effort-wise), and my knee cap (?!?! ouch!) (which ended up irritating the tendons tremendously--and I tried to gently suggest that knee-cap shifting does not help me...and she didn't listen and it was awkward...) and then did the wrong side when she did finally get to the QL and never moved on to the other side. WHOOPS. So I left off lopsided and furious. For me, there are few things more excruciating than a bad massage.Like I said, I feel bad giving a negative review because employee-wise--front desk, management, were all kind, but I cannot recommend anyone to go here for a deep tissue massage."
245,MED_58,"Dr. Ty and the team at AHC are extremely attentive and accessible. I routinely call for same-day appointments and am seen without delay. The location could not be more convenient - whether you are working downtown, living east side, west side or right across the street - the team at AHC won't disappoint. I typically see results in the same day - but what is the best part for me is the onsite combination of chiropractic care and the sports medicine doctor they have on staff. Keep up the great work AHC team...or else..."
246,MED_58,"I would highly recommend this place to anyone in need of a chiropractor, physical therapist, or a medical massage. The staff is amazing and really takes an interest in who you are and their focus is getting you better as soon as possible. The environment is welcoming and the staff is very personable. I never once had a bad experience. Allied is nothing but the best and if you want a fast recovery or relief of pain this is the place to go!"
247,MED_58,"I have been a patient at AHC for several years and through multiple weekend warrior injuries, including a car accident.  I had been to several other chiropractors and physical therapists in the past, but by far the staff here is the best and I feel like they actually care about me and how I feel.  Their new office is beautiful and the staff is always friendly.  I get to see everyone I need in the same office so it's very convenient for me. There are both medical doctors, physical therapists and chiropractic treatment there. Also they were all in my insurance network."
248,MED_60,"If there's a better place for physical therapy on earth, I have yet to find a better one than Benchmark Physical Therapy.I have been to every TP practitioner from LA to NYC, and my discovery of Benchmark in Midtown Atlanta was the best single decision of my life. While most PT places are cold and uncaring, Benchmark is friendly and supportive. Where most PTs just ""go through the motions"" of helping you, showing you a few boring exercises and telling you to ""roll on the big ball..."", Benchmark explains and demonstrates a level of expertise that I never even new existed, anywhere.It started the moment I just picked them from a big list I got from my physician. The first person I talked to was a terrific woman named, 'Holly,' who moved heaven and earth to get me in as soon as possible, after I'd torn my rotator cuff from my arduous relocation to ATL. But meeting my therapist, one Sam Crowley, was the greatest single experience I've ever had by any TP of the past 27-years. His understanding of physical therapy (he has a doctor degree in the profession... rare indeed) and his THOROUGHNESS, PROFESSIONALISM, AND ABILITY TO PROVIDE ME NEARLY MIRACULOUS RELIEF FROM MY DEBILITATING PAIN WAS SOMETHING TO BEHOLD. I have never had anyone actually use physical manipulation to provide immediate relief. In my second week, he even introduced a form of accupuncture for my injury that gave me even MORE pain relief. Unbelievable. Now, instead of dreading going to my PT, I actually look forward to it! If you value your health, if you're looking for someone with the ability to give you the hands-on care you deserve, if you're looking for the best in the business, look no further. Please give Benchmark Midtown a call, and please tell their entire staff that I personally told you to call these marvelous people. I feel blessed just have found them."
249,MED_60,"Awesome experience here! Kyle was amazing and helped me through my elbow injury with various exercises, stretches, and massage. He always made sure I was comfortable and was rooting for me during my recovery. There was a wide variety of equipment and tools available to help me regain my strength and flexibility. In addition, all the staff were friendly and welcoming, and I definitely enjoyed my weekly visits. Thank you BenchMark!"
250,MED_60,"As a former Personal Trainer, fitness and recovery from unintended accidents was always a thought in the back of my mind. When the dreaded day came it rocked my world and effected my employment. Fortunately, I was advised to visit BenchMark Physical Therapy. I could never have been recommended a more professional, courteous, or knowledgeable group of recovery experts. Allison Kuzma, and Jeff Sondergard are second to none. Steady improvements mixed with clear concise information are their trademark; 100% satisfaction is their hallmark. The English language is inadequate to express my full appreciation for their dedication to my recovery. And, their staff...Holli, the voice on the ""Bench"" makes it a totally rewarding experience."
251,MED_60,Stellar place for PT - Christina and the rest of the staff get top marks for getting me back to pre-surgery levels of competition.
252,MED_60,"I called in asking for a self-pay rate (no insurance) and was able to get scheduled within 4 hours of calling in, and also had a clear self-pay rate ($90/session, with the first session being $180). The doctor had an intern shadowing her and they did a bunch of tests before prescribing some exercises for me and setting me up for appointments this and next week.This definitely feels like a more communal space with lots of people in the same room, so way less hoity-toity than a couple other places I have been to recently, but their process was efficient, their staff was good, and I thought it was a fair price after the ridiculous price OrthoAtlanta quoted me. I'll update this after 2 weeks of therapy but so far, I've been really impressed.Things they could improve on: they have no patient portal, so I can't self-schedule my follow up appointments, which sucks. Also, they use paper forms for everything, whereas I'd like to be able to fill out forms before getting to the office and being able to retrieve those easily when needed. I'm not sure where all this paper goes, because it didn't seem like they had a super sophisticated system"
253,MED_61,"I've had chronic pain in my back and hips for the last 10 years. I have stenosis and severe arthritis, which has resulted in a lumbar laminectomy (2009) and R & L hip replacements (2014). My pain had gotten worse over time, forcing me to curtail my activities or even to get out of bed. I saw a neurologist 2 months ago, who ordered Physical Therapy (PT) for the pain and stiffness I experienced. I started with Joe Kafati, DPT, who gave me deep tissue massages to relieve pain, spasms and to increase mobility. He taught me a series of stretching and strength-enhancing exercises for my abdomen and thighs. I felt improvement after the first week; I was able to straighten up in the morning and walk around with significant relief of my hips and back!Joe and the staff at Rebound PT work as a team, always welcoming and helpful. I was given hope and a new start in life, with significantly less pain. I am comfortable with the exercises I will do at home to maintain my flexibility and comfort with activity. I am so glad to have had this therapy after a decade of progressive pain. Thank goodness to Joe and all the PT staff, I will run (or skip) back there for any additional health or mobility needs!"
254,MED_61,"Went to Rebound for pre and post surgery for a torn meniscus. The entire staff is great! Joe and Bradley worked with me. While there was plenty of sweat and hard work, their attitudes and personalities made the process enjoyable. Good at listening to any concerns. Good at pushing me but also good at cautioning me from overdoing anything. Just what I needed!"
255,MED_61,"Joe and the staff at Rebound are great! They actually listen to you, look at any reports you bring (MRI, X-ray, etc) and seem genuinely caring. I will absolutely go back with any future needs!"
256,MED_61,"I have had issues with my hip for the years and after many doctors and physical therapists, was referred to Joe at Rebound. Joe is just awesome! He is fun and friendly and a great physical therapist. I had pain just balancing on my leg and after the first appointment, felt so much better with significantly less pain.The equipment and facility are both clean, modern and new and is a great environment for PT. The staff are also professional and frienfly."
257,MED_61,Rebound Physical Therapy is a fabulous facility with skilled doctors and a friendly staff. I fell running and earned myself compression fractures in the bottom of my femur in May. Joe has been instrumental in reducing the pain while helping me rebuild my muscles from stopping running. He is excellent at asking questions and listening to understand what is causing the pain and the source of it to correctly and efficiently treat the pain and aid in an effective recovery. Joe assigned home exercises to work with my weekly PT sessions and also provided alternate exercises for when I was on 1000 mile road trips to do while sitting.
258,MED_61,Outstanding staff. Rebound PT has a friendly and supportive team who are concerned for your recovery. There is no question where I will go if I need PT services again.
259,MED_62,"Dr. Eric and Dr. Meeks were very professional and I feel great every time I leave their office. The overall staff is always very friendly and my appointments are prompt, which is good with my busy schedule!I would highly recommend to anyone looking for chiropractic care in the Cleveland area."
260,MED_62,"Meh. Not great. $150 for initial visit which included a lot of interview and waiting. The place seemed dirty and felt like a warehouse. There were temporary walls put up to block visually but nothing to block the sound of other chatty patients. There was a guy with a voice like Roseanne Bar's husband Dan. I could here him the whole time. I could tell you his life story. He works third shift, likes to take his Addrroll in the afternoon and his ambiance when he gets off work. Bla bla bla. He was soooo loud. They put me through a super long interview and then put me in a room to do stem on but on such a low power that I couldn't feel it, even after I asked her to turn it up the voltage. Plus the massage table looked dirty. There were oil and lotion marks on the table meaning they don't clean between clients. Then the chiropractor saw me for 1 minute and only adjusted one spot. The massage therapist was nice but it was short. What a waste of time, money, and life."
261,MED_62,great practice and great staff. They truly care about patients and take your care seriously. Dr Ty is a great chiropractor and they have various medical staff as well. They are great at what they do and they took care of my back with adjustments as well as therapy.
262,MED_62,"EXCELLENT. I tried a number of places in Cleveland before finding AHC. I have now been going regularly for years - every time I injure myself. I use and have used their chiropractic, massage and physio staff, all of whom are really, really good at what they do.  Wonderful staff, great service, very effective. They have a number of people in every position, making sure that there is variety and breadth of expertise. THE BEST FACILITY IN CLEVELAND, and probably the best I've used in any of the cities I have lived in."
263,MED_62,"I am sorry to say that I was not very impressed with the care I received at AHC. I went in for a sports injury that I expected would require some PT. I ended up working with a Nurse Practitioner and the Physical Therapist. Both of these women were not who is listed under ""Staff"" on their website. I know it's a little thing, but I like to be able to do some background research on the people treating me before I go to my appointment. So it was just surprising to be seen by new people. Why are these people not on their website?Everyone was very ""nice,"" but I felt rushed in both of my appointments and did not get the sense that anybody wanted to really focus on my specific issue and the background behind my injury. My experience with the Nurse Practitioner was fine, but nothing special. But my experience with the PT was truly underwhelming. First, I get there at 5:15 for a 5:30 appointment. I didn't get called back until around 5:45. And when the PT comes to bring me back for my appointment, she says ""I hear you're having some low back issues!"" However, I don't have any low back issues; I have anterior hip pain! Then she is taking notes on her computer when I am describing my issue and pain points when her computer dies. She then says ""my computer died. But no problem, it's not important."" If it's not important, why are you taking notes in the first place? And maybe it is important so you'll actually know what my issue is for my next appointment. Around 6PM, the PT told me that I just bruised my hip joint. But there was no explanation why a strong, healthy 25 year old is bruising is hip joint and why we could induce pain unweighted, etc. She just told me to ""stretch"" and gave a basic hamstring stretch. When I asked about stability exercises, her immediate response at 6:02PM was ""I will show you some, but just so you know, we close at 6. But I will let stay a little late this time."" However, I got there at 5:15 and wasn't called back until 5:45! I believe I should be entitled to my full allotment of time, and didn't appreciate her being in such a rush to leave--especially considering it was they who were running late.Also, their hours are not super convenient. The latest they are open is 6PM, which is not super helpful if you work to 5:30. This is only a small complaint compared to the quality of care received, but it is still something that could be improved. I wanted to enjoy my experience at AHC, but I was just underwhelmed and disappointed. I went somewhere else, and the experience was night and day."
264,MED_62,"Been to several chiropractors and by far the best to date. Treatment of stim, adjustment, and massage every visit has my pain and discomfort virtually gone. Staff is friendly, visits are on time and efficient. I won't be going anywhere else anytime soon."
265,MED_62,"This place is horrible. At first the treatment is great, but after about 2 weeks it starts to turn. This staff and company puts themselves before the patients. Don't have a patient do almost 2 hours of therapy and then not get a massage like they are supposed to do. Its not our problem that the company or staff decides to over book. I requested my medical records from them a week in a half in advance so i could follow up with my orthopedic. Of course that didn't happen. Oh and not to mention that you go there for therapy and they don't even send your final results to the doctor. They just say your done and follow up with your doctor if your still in pain. What kind of crap is that????!!! So im here at my orthopedic appointment and have no results for my therapy. I asked them to send them now please, which its 9:40 am on a Tuesday. They said they can't until tomorrow. Really??? You cant take 5 mins of your time to fax your records? I will NEVER go back here nor will i ever recommend it so someone. They just opened and i feel they need to be closed. Just horrible, they do it for the money not the patient."
266,MED_62,"Rude staff. They lost my paperwork and then required me to jump through hoops for my visit, requiring a doctor release although I prior treatment with their office. I left having wasted my time."
267,MED_62,"Not only do I go to AHC for regular maintenance, but so do many of our athletes at CrossFit Sixth City and Cleveland Strength and Conditioning. We regularly utilize their awesome chiropractors, massage therapists and PT for maintenance, injuries and health evaluations and screenings for ourselves and our athletes. I also look forward to working with the new ART specialist. There is many places I personally trust with my health and wellness. AHC won't let you down."
268,MED_62,"First I want to say the actual physical massage was great - 4 stars there!! However....I went here on a Groupon for a 60-minute deep tissue massage. The hours here are quite strict and do not include weekends! This makes calling and obtaining an appointment difficult. I finally requested an appointment online and a friendly receptionist called me back a few days later. Subsequent calls on the day of my appointment to see if I could move it up earlier and again for directions were answered promptly and in a friendly manner. Even though I called about being seen early I was actually seen....you guessed it! Late! I would have rather been told 'no I couldn't be seen early' than be told to come early and then not even be seen at my initial appointment time!! The receptionist even left talking on her mobile while I will still waiting. The office is inside the main building of Lutheran Hospital. Go in the main doors. Right. Find the elevator in the far right corner. Go to floor ""1"". Find suite 1000 - A+ for signage to the suite. They have a one person (not spotlessly clean) bathroom in their office but have no keys to the restroom down the hall. The office was old: carpeting, waiting room chairs, etc... The quality of the massage was great, however it was done in a room with two overhead florescent lights so not very peaceful. And the breath of the lady working on me was a mixture of smoke/mint gum. Gross. And when it was time to lie face down the face cradle was covered in several crinkly and rough bathroom paper towels instead of a soft maybe even warmed towel. All in all I won't be back - I can get just as good a massage elsewhere plus a good environment."
269,MED_62,I had a terrible pain in the back of my neck and that extended down to my back which both were causing a headache. This had been going on for 2 weeks so I was in need of a chiropractor. I did a Yelp and Google search and found Allied Health and saw they were close to my office. I got in that same day when I called and Dr.Ty took care f my issue. The entire staff was friendly and knowledgeable about my issue and identified what I had going on. Highly recommend this place
270,MED_62,"The people in the office were all very nice and helpful, however, I was unspeakably disappointed with the massage I received, especially since someone I know told me to go here. I'm so confused. I was very specific with what I needed done--I came to get a massage that would help alleviate low back and knee pain, not a massage for pleasure--and continued to try and communicate that the pressure was not enough. And when she did give me more pressure, it was strange and not at all logical. She also didn't get to the two main areas I explicitly said were giving me trouble. I assumed she was going to get to both sides, but instead she spent all her time on my shoulders (probably because that's easier than the QL, piriformis, effort-wise), and my knee cap (?!?! ouch!) (which ended up irritating the tendons tremendously--and I tried to gently suggest that knee-cap shifting does not help me...and she didn't listen and it was awkward...) and then did the wrong side when she did finally get to the QL and never moved on to the other side. WHOOPS. So I left off lopsided and furious. For me, there are few things more excruciating than a bad massage.Like I said, I feel bad giving a negative review because employee-wise--front desk, management, were all kind, but I cannot recommend anyone to go here for a deep tissue massage."
271,MED_62,"Dr. Ty and the team at AHC are extremely attentive and accessible. I routinely call for same-day appointments and am seen without delay. The location could not be more convenient - whether you are working downtown, living east side, west side or right across the street - the team at AHC won't disappoint. I typically see results in the same day - but what is the best part for me is the onsite combination of chiropractic care and the sports medicine doctor they have on staff. Keep up the great work AHC team...or else..."
272,MED_62,"I would highly recommend this place to anyone in need of a chiropractor, physical therapist, or a medical massage. The staff is amazing and really takes an interest in who you are and their focus is getting you better as soon as possible. The environment is welcoming and the staff is very personable. I never once had a bad experience. Allied is nothing but the best and if you want a fast recovery or relief of pain this is the place to go!"
273,MED_62,"I have been a patient at AHC for several years and through multiple weekend warrior injuries, including a car accident.  I had been to several other chiropractors and physical therapists in the past, but by far the staff here is the best and I feel like they actually care about me and how I feel.  Their new office is beautiful and the staff is always friendly.  I get to see everyone I need in the same office so it's very convenient for me. There are both medical doctors, physical therapists and chiropractic treatment there. Also they were all in my insurance network."
274,MED_63,"I cannot say enough good things about Intown PT. Ingrid is a magician. When I injured my shoulder, I thought I could fix it with no issues. I stretched, did sauna, cryo, reiki massage, sports massage, even energy healing. I went to Ingrid 2 hours ago and already feel 90% better. I don't understand how someone can be so good at their job."
275,MED_63,"After an urgent care visit for a pulled muscle in my neck, I called Intown PT. Muscle relaxers, pain meds - nothing was helping. Two dry needling sessions in, I was good as new. Almost miraculous, frankly. Highly recommend."
276,MED_63,"Both Ingrid and Jennifer are great. They used dry needling and other techniques to cure my back pain. I had gone to chiropractors and physical therapy for years with limited relief. But after a few sessions with them, my back stopped hurting for the first time in many years. I still have a sensitive back but nothing like before seeing them. One more thing, the receptionist, Katy is very efficient and easy to work with."
277,MED_63,Intown PT is fantastic! They helped me regain mobility in my hips that I thought was out of my reach. I highly recommend them to anyone who leads an active lifestyle.
278,MED_63,"OK, here's the deal: by looking at the red-cord contraption hanging from the ceiling, you'd think it was a S&M sex machine. (Not that I'd know - honest.) But after 2+ months of a disastrous lower back situation--to the point where I thought I was in traction--the *entire problem literally melted away. Ingrid Anderson is not only good at what she does--she's a phenomenally great person to talk to and confide in as well. Trustworthy, smart and dynamic. Bring your issues and she'll know how to fix them. She had surprising, drill-down knowledge of my male-centric issues and had a pointed empathy that really struck a cord (letter changed for the intended bad pun).In addition to all that, Ingrid gave me some great pointers on how to exercise in a smarter way that doesn't tax the body as hard as traditional stuff. It's a tack I'm going to take from now on to protect against injury in the future.So, if you're ailing about something, go. You'll leave there feeling better and smarter about your body. I promise."
279,MED_63,"I went to see Ingrid after having back and sciatic pain that would not go away. I was having trouble even getting in and out of my car. She performed a thorough intake and and was very interested in helping to find the right treatment for my issue. She did a needling technique I had never tried before - and the next day, the pain was gone! After one more follow up visit and some exercises to do at home, I'm doing much better. She is very kind and attentive and made me feel immediately at ease. Would highly recommend!!"
280,MED_63,Dr. Ingrid is an exceptional doctor. She used a technique known as dry-needling that totally healed my back. The office is in a great location and the entire staff is friendly. If you want a healing find Dr. E!
281,MED_63,"I was suffering from upper back pain between and around my shoulders that was causing me to pop Advil and Tylenol throughout the day like snacks and that was impacting my ability to concentrate. I saw Dr. Anderson and she did an amazing job treating me for the pain. By the time, I left that first visit my pain had dramatically improved, and it was completely gone by the time of our second visit a few days later. Dr. Anderson was very detail oriented, patiently soliciting the details of my pain and then providing me with information about what she believed was at the root of my troubles while suggesting how she was going to approach the therapy. She was very attentive, agreeable, and approachable and I felt well informed at every step of the treatment.I would recommend Dr. Anderson for anyone suffering from recurring muscular skeletal pains. I now know where to go should my neck or back trouble me again!"
282,MED_63,"Physical Therapy is a tricky one for me. I think I'm like most people when I say, all I want is fast results and very little homework. Dr. Anderson understood this all too well, and did a fantastic job at satisfying this while also providing me with some real pain relief. For years I have been avoiding doing activities that consistently result in pain, but it got to the point where there were few activities left I could do, and it was time to not only treat some acute pain I was suffering from a kickboxing injury, but to figure out the root problem. I've had 3 sessions and my acute pain is gone, and preventable in the future with the exercises I have (and I'm back at kickboxing!). With the underlying causes, we've been working together, and I've noticed I'm having considerably less day-to-day pain, which I had just got used to. Faith in PT is restored."
283,MED_63,"I came in to see Dr. Anderson for a wrist issue that is usually just a recurring annoyance and had transformed in to a full scale pain issue. I type a LOT for work, particularly leading up to the summer months, and my right wrist had gotten bad enough that I couldn't look at it without hurting! I went in and ten minutes later (only a few of them excruciating!) I was able to walk out feeling confident my hand wouldn't fall off. She gave me some really easy massage techniques I can do on my own while watching TV and voila! My husband has some outstanding back issues that he's just started seeing Dr. Anderson for and she's been wonderful. He tends to tense up when he thinks a ""pop"" is coming which makes traditional mobilization difficult. She's done some massage and small mobilizations on his spine and plans to use the red cord system to help him get back on track.What I love most about Dr. Anderson isn't that she gets results, it's that she really cares about her patients and is passionate about what she does. Whether I've seen her in office or out and about, she really tries to educate people on the way their bodies work and how to keep them healthy without being a total loon. She recognizes that people will always do things that are bad for them (playing nine straight hours of video games, working for 60 hours a week at the computer, wearing flip flops...) and tries to give her patients the tools they need to get through their bad habits without breaking themselves. She's personable and professional and her office staff (comprised of the amazing Amber) is flexible and helpful. Don't tell her this, but my clumsy ass is thankful for a PT nearby who will put up with me!"
284,MED_63,"I first visited Intown Physical Therapy to address a long-time shoulder issue exacerbated by a recent injury. Ingrid was extremely thorough in her review of my range of motion, pain points, strength issues, etc. and in a matter of weeks was able to get my shoulder not only functional again, but back in the gym with targeted exercised to rehab and restrengthen - and no surgery! Since then I've been back several times with different issues (knee, hip) and am experiencing the same results. Ingrid's deep and up-to-date knowledge of body mechanics combined with her awesome ""bedside manner"" has earned my trust. Her staff is great as well - very friendly, accommodating, and flexible; I've never had issues getting scheduled in short order. I highly recommend ITP!"
285,MED_63,"After reading all of Dr. Anderson's amazing reviews, I was very hopeful that she could help me. She was not covered by my insurance, but I really needed someone who would take the time to understand what was going on with my uncommon ailment.At my first appointment, I made it clear to Dr. Anderson that I was not really looking for treatment as I was waiting on surgery to correct my problem. I wanted suggestions for an exercise program I could do with my significant physical limitations until my surgery. She said she could provide that and also suggested a treatment option. I advised Dr. Anderson that I had little to no hope that her suggested treatment option would work because I had been doing years of similar treatments at other practices with zero improvement; however, since it wouldn't hurt anything to try and I was already there, I agreed to it. After approximately four appointments (and $400 later), I had no improvement in my pain and Dr. Anderson had shown me one exercise that could work for me. At the last appointment I had with her, she said she would write up a program and email it to me.I never heard from her again. I tried calling her office a dozen or so times during regular business hours. Sometimes I received the answering service but several times I was able to get through to the receptionist. The receptionist let me know the office didn't get the messages I left with the answering service. The last time I was able to reach the receptionist, I explained that I had not received the exercises Dr. Anderson had promised and would like to speak with Dr. Anderson. I emphasized that Dr. Anderson was not returning my messages. The receptionist told me he would personally make sure Dr. Anderson called me back as soon as she walked in the door. I did not hear from the office again. I tried many times after that to reach the office but my phone calls were not answered.I feel very disappointed with my experience at this office. I do not feel that I would recommend this provider to anyone."
286,MED_63,I've been working with Jennifer at IPT for a couple of months now. I had a rotator cuff injury in November 2015 and she's helped me enormously in dealing with the pain and providing exercises to help with healing. She's just wonderful - she's strong but gentle as needed and fully explains what she's doing and why. She asks questions and educates you as she's working with you.
287,MED_63,"I could not imagine a better experience with a physical therapist- I walked into Dr. Anderson's office barely able to walk after an accident at work that left me in agonizing lower back pain. I needed for someone to pull out all the stops, since I have a very active job that requires me to be on my feet constantly, and that she did. IN ABUNDANCE. She was incredibly gentle, and what I thought was back pain that would put me out of commission for weeks (or more!) was resolved in two days. Seriously, I hobbled pathetically into her office on a Wednesday, went to work on Thursday, went back for a brief follow-up and was dancing by Friday!"
288,MED_63,"Dr. Anderson is an outstanding physical therapist. She quickly assessed my problem and had me back on my feet ( or using my knee, to be exact) in no time. Her office is pleasant, friendly and has easy access. Her wealth of knowledge and understanding of the body is clear to see.If you are hurting, go to see her!"
289,MED_63,"I have been receiving therapy for postpartum back and hip pain. So far, I have been very impressed. The young woman who signed me in was courteous and knowledgeable. I found immediate relief from my hip pan after our appointment, and was given exercises to work on improving my abdominal tone to help with the back pain. Dr. Anderson was professional without being stuffy. I felt as though I was in very good hands. I am going back for follow-up treatment in the coming weeks!"
290,MED_63,"Dr. Anderson takes a unique approach with patient care. In the interest of full disclosure, I am a PT myself, albeit not in the same setting, so I am skeptical and always ask questions. She took my suggestions and ideas seriously and I felt involved in the decision making process. She was interested in hearing what I felt the problem was as what it was preventing me from doing. In my case, I had goals to participate in several road races that my injury was preventing. From there, she didn't just say, ""Do these exercises."" Instead, she designed a treatment plan that involved clinic time that just wasn't repeating my home program. Add to that, I had a do-able home exercise program. After several sessions at Intown PT, I was able to attain my first goal by competing in my 10K race. With no pain and greatly improved strength, I am now preparing for my next race this fall. Thank you!!"
291,MED_64,"Our son injured his shoulder in a rugby match and he had gotten therapy here. They took special care of my teen and in the weeks that were projected, our son was well on his way to recovery. Shortly thereafter, our son also dances and took 1st Place in Okinawa with an almost 100% repaired shoulder. Thanks to the entire caring staff."
292,MED_64,"This place is great! It was also covered by my Anthem PPO! I had previously gone to another PT place and it didnt do much for me since there was only one appointment per week that accommodated my work schedule. That's when I discovered this place. Their last appointment is at 5pm, which works perfectly with my work schedule so I was able to go 3 times a week after work. I didn't think my tennis elbows would ever get better, but with a very consistent therapy of warm compress, massage, and these cool hammer machines, the pain receded. After months of pain I legit thought I was a lost cause. The staff is super friendly and they have televisions that have the food channel (or sports), so that's an even bigger bonus for killing the boredom while sitting there immobile. PARKING: Giant private lot"
293,MED_64,"I absolutely love, love, love this team! I have had my neck and knee rehabbed by this team and it has made a HUGE difference in my quality of life. Every single member of the team is professional, conscientious, and caring. They are also a lot of fun to hang around. Do consider them first if you are looking for any type of PT treatment. You will get excellent care!"
294,MED_64,"I have been going to Advanced Orthopedic Physical Therapy for just over a year now. I have had a complicated knee replacement and have had to have a total of 3 surgeries on my right knee. I have worked with Patti, Solomon and Russ. Russ is my main guy and he has kept me in the best shape he can due to my issues. I have lately graduate to a Blood Restriction machine for my leg and it has worked me more in such a short period, 2 sessions with 225 reps each day plus today added 10 minutes on the stationary bike today. The people are all great to work with and the atmosphere is friendly also. Thanks everyone at Advanced Orthopedic for your help."
295,MED_64,"I cannot write a review that would adequately report how excellent Patty, Russ, Solomon and the rest of the staff are at this facility. I have had arthroscopic need surgery and two spinal fusions. Between the in office visits and the fantastic aqua therapy my recovery has been nothing short of remarkable - and enjoyable. I am tough customer, by the way, so, you have to quite good to impress me. They impress me. Thank you!"
296,MED_64,"I am sooooo grateful for all the healing the people at this place have brought to my life! I was suffering from plantar fasciitis and achilles tendonitis for 1.5 years and after seeing two other PT places, this was the only place that helped me :-) I received PT for about 5 months and improved significantly. My physical therapist was Solomon along with the PT assistants. Here is the rundown: they begin with a 15 min. hot wrap on my feet, they lasered my feet (to promote healing) for about 5mins. a foot followed by another type of laser with warm gel (for about 5mins. a foot), they use this powerful massage machine they call ""the hammer"" on my entire calves (to help with my knots), hand massage on each foot which hurt at times but gave me such relief, and finally ending with taping of my feet that gave me lots of arch support. This place deals with lots of athletes from CSULB, therfore I knew I was in the right place to begin with! Athletes ALWAYS get the best treatment, rght? I've seen them work on people with shoulder, knee, hip, and hand problems.I definitely recommend this place, plus everyone is super nice!"
297,MED_64,I Had a work knee injury that needed to get better. I was sent to Advanced Orthopedic from Kaiser. It is a very friendly and professional atmosphere. My physical therapist was Patty along with the amazing assistants. They will all keep you on track while you do your stretches and exercises. And will remind you if you forget any. :)
298,MED_64,I just wanted to let people know how good these guys are. They have a very caring staff they ask how things are working for you. They take their time and work on what you need them to work on. If something is not working they change it up. I feel very comfortable sending everyone I know here for I know how well they will be taken care of. I highly recommend coming here for all your pains.
299,MED_64,"I've had several sports/work injuries through the years that required rehab. Of all the PT offices I've used, AOPT is the BEST bar none. Patti and her staff are courteous, attentive, and very knowledgable. I was referred to AOPT by my Kerlin/Jobe surgeon, Dr. Kvitne who considers AOPT tops in their field - and I certainly concur."
300,MED_64,"The crew at AOPT has now helped me rehab both my left and right ACL tears (4 years apart). I was living in Long Beach when I tore the first one and was referred to them by Dr. Yocum (RIP) from Kerlan Jobe. At the time, it was my first major operation and I had no idea what to expect, but I knew I had a long road ahead.Everyone at AOPT is friendly, generous and, above all, professional. They're really all about the patient. I've been worked on by Patti, Solomon and Rus, and they're nothing but attentive to your needs and ultimately, your rehab goals. Even the assistants (Arianne, Marivic, Heather, Allen) are constantly checking and making sure you're doing your exercises correctly. During sessions, I push myself hard. When I'm not feeling it, the crew at AOPT know when to motivate and they know when to reel you back so you don't do more damage than good. They're hands-on when they need to be and let you work at your own pace otherwise. Up front, Kim makes scheduling and billing a breeze and always has a smile.I didn't know if I'd come back 100% from my first ACL but it feels great and I don't give it a second thought when playing sports. So much so that surgery on my second ACL tear wasn't even a question and the decision to come back to AOPT for rehab was made without hesitation. The ability to be active and mobile is everything to me and I'm extremely thankful for everyone at AOPT."
301,MED_64,"Excellent in care, excellent in hands on therapy, and excellent staff. It is a rare find when all three of these attributes come together. Advanced Orthopedic Physical Therapy in Signal Hill, is one of those finds. I suffered a severe leg / ankle break and had fears that I would never have the full use of my limb again.  With the guidance of Patti and her staff and 5 months of hard work, I am feeling great and looking forward again to walking, biking, and golfing. The attention to detail, in what exercises were needed, the amount of repetitions, the execution of each exercise and the care given in working the affected injury, left me with a sense of comfort knowing that my therapist was an integral part of my recovery. The staff was always willing to accommodate my needs and help with a smile, a warm hello and my next appointments. This injury has given me a new family and a great recovery experience. Thanks to all :)Carla Y."
302,MED_64,"I've literally never experienced such bad customer service. They are the worst PTs in long beach and to have staff tell you ""oh we should have called you is not ok"" hire people that can do their jobs."
303,MED_64,"After I was diagnosed with severe spinal and cervical injuries that warranted surgery per two neuro specialist a third opinion referred me to AOP for therapy.  6 months later I am moving with less restriction and feel as if I have found a new family.  The therapist listen and take care of business.  Thank you Solomon, Russ and the AOP family.   Lots of exercise but no surgery in the near future."
304,MED_64,"I have been going to AOPT for about a year, I went there for my first acl, and unfortunately tore my other one, I did not hesitate when picking out a PT place again, I went straight back to them. They are flexible with getting you an appointment, they have plenty of assistance so you will never be alone. All the workers there are the friendliest people and I have developed a relationship with all of them. Excellent care, my knee that I initially hurt is stronger than ever, and I can definately tell my other knee is on the road to success. Their office is just an all around friendly enviornment and I can easily start a conversation with the staff and other patients. I strongly encourage that if AOPT is an option, that you should pick it and you will have not one bad thing to say about it."
305,MED_64,"I have been to 2 other PT offices in the past. The 1st one was a couple years ago for my lower back. My back wasn't that bad but it would hurt when I would stand in one place for a prolonged period of time. But pretty much all they did was give me exercises to do at home & then would kinda ""watch"" me (while they were working with other clients) during my session to make sure I was doing them correctly. They never touched me with a massage or anything. I didn't know any better since I hadn't been to PT's before but looking back, it seems very unethical that they collected the insurance money--like they stole the money! The second place --I came in because my leg had a shooting pain which later I found out was probably caused because of my lower back issue but all the therapist did was work on my leg. I stopped after a while because it wasn't really helping and it was sooo painful for the therapist to massage the area! Then about a year ago I went to a ""Boot Camp"" 5 days a week and really exacerbated my back! My lower back became so painful, I couldn't sleep at night. I started going to Advanced Orthopedic PT at a friend's recommendation where I was assigned to the Physical Therapist, Solomon Joseph. It was amazing how great he took care of me! I never thought that I would ever be able to sleep through the night again but I am great now! I don't even think about my back at all! He gave me exercises that I did daily at home while I was going through therapy which strengthened my lower back tremendously. In addition to the exercises he assigned for home, so much more was done during each of my sessions. Heat, Ultrasound, ""Stim"", 15 minute Hand Massage, a crazy, amazing device that Solomon lovingly called the ""Jack Hammer"" which gives the effect of an hour long massage in 5 minutes time. When he 1st started doing hand massage on my back, there were at least 4-5 vertebrae in my back that he would press on that would hurt REALLY bad but after 25 sessions (what my insurance allows), it was almost non-existent! I was amazed! I remember asking him at the beginning if I would ever be pain free (because I was in so much pain, I figured I was going to be messed up the rest of my life!) and he assured me I would get better and he was right!! Solomon taught me how to protect my back and never to go back to a Boot Camp!! I totally recommend Solomon! He has been a therapist for 25-30 years so when you go to him, you are getting a very experienced and successful therapist! All of the support staff are so wonderful too--Kim in the front office, as well as the numerous aids that do ultrasound on you or apply heat or ice--such nice people, every one of them! I also loved that they opened at 7:30am & I could go before work!"
306,MED_65,Both my daughter and I have undergone physical therapy at this center in Roselle. The staff are friendly and professional. We were given clear instructions for everything and our conditions improved quickly. We will definitely return here if we need pt in the future.
307,MED_66,"Booked reserved seats from Atlanta to Nashville to go to a concert and spend an evening bar hopping. Didn't want to spend the money to fly and I hate driving so we figured we'd try the megabus. It was not bad at all. $16 RT and an additional $20 for reserved seats for a total of $36 for both! Both troops were pretty uneventful, which is a good thing. Drivers were professional and courteous. Load in and out went without issues. Wifi didn't work on the way to Nashville and was spotty on the way back, but I used my mobile hotspot. Power was great to have so my phone had a full charge so we could navigate around Nashville. Highly suggest reserving the front seats on the top level. Not sure I'd want to take the bus sitting an any other seat. The seats are a bit cramped but livable. That was the only downside. If traveling alone, I would book the seat next to me as an extra seat so I wasn't crammed against a stranger."
308,MED_66,The level of service is horrible from the people in Atlanta That check your ticket and take your bags. The staff talks to customers like we are a piece of shyt under their shoe. My bus on May 18 was due to leave 7am didnt leave till 820 for Nashville. I witnessed my bus parked down the street from 630am till 810amAfter my trip to Nashville I called customer service to no avail for a refund. Both times I called I spoke to a third world country handling their customer service. These are scripted not to assist with service issues.THIS IS SPIRIT AIRLINES ON WHEELSDO NOT USE THIS SERVICETHEY DESERVE A ZERO RATING
309,MED_66,"I just had the WORST experience with Megabus. I went to Charlotte NC on megabus and returned on megabus today. The bus was on time departing from Charlotte. The once non- stop trip now stops in Athens. On the journey to Atlanta, the bus pulled off from Athens. The driver appeared to be struggling to get the bus out of first gear. It was easy to conclude that we were breaking down due to a failed transmission! The bus driver was very honest and up front. He noted that a bus was on the way and would arrive in 40 min. ( this was after about 45 min of trying o fix the problem). Several patrons opted to simply call a lyft or uber. I was able to get home with a shared lyft for an additional cost of course! I contacted megabus to receive a refund. I was told that they can only give me a voucher for future use on another bus ticket. I expressed that I will not be riding megabus again and would like a refund. After speaking with the supervisor she advised there was no one else for me to talk to about getting a refund. She suggested I go online and document my request!!-- are you serious???!! Your website markets that you pride yourself on safety. How is it safe putting a double decker o the road with transmission problems? My advice- RIDE AT YOUR OWN RISK!"
310,MED_66,"We changed buses at the Civic Center MARTA station, 435 W Peachtree St NW, Atlanta, GANot much in the area. Around the corner there is a Mellow Mushroom and a place to grab a lite lunch or a coffee. Review:My brother and I rode the Megabus (in June 2018) from Dallas, TX all the way to Richmond, VA, with a bus changes in Memphis, TN and Atlanta, GA. I'm going to share the same review with those Megabus Yelp business pages. Our trip took around 36 hours. First, the bad: WiFi did not work on ANY of the three buses we rode. It's time consuming. Our journey was 36 hours end to end. Cleanliness of bathroom deteriorates rapidly as the journey wears on. I considered it ""For emergency use only."" There is no running water. There might have been hand sanitizer. Now the good. Inexpensive. Nothing beat it. Not Greyhound. Not Amtrak. If you have more time than money, or just want an adventure, Megabus is OK. Buses were clean. Buses have a bathroom, but it's nothing more than a chemical toilet. It was an adventure. 110 volt A/C power outlets did work on all buses. Oh, and since it was summer, there were no airline deals either. The bus stops about every 2 hours for a break. It generally stopped at a truck stop, where you could use a restroom with running water, and get something to eat. Our bus change in Memphis was long. It gave us enough time to take an Uber to Beale St. It was also at night. Neighborhood was kinda sketchy, but there was indoor waiting area with vending machines and bathrooms. There's a gas station next door that serves hot food. Our bus change in Atlanta was shorter, but it was long enough to search out some breakfast within walking distance. It was morning for this stop. Neighborhood was OK. There was no indoor waiting area and I think there were restrooms if you went in the MARTA station (below). We arrived in Richmond at night and walked to our hotel. I did not seeing any waiting area, though it is close to the (Amtrak) train station, in the Main Street Station, so there might be something there. There are waiting rooms, but I don't know the hours. yelp.com/biz/main-street\xe2\x80\xa6 About the bus: It's a double-decker bus. If you are prone to motion sickness, there is less sway on the bottom, but try to get toward the front, as the bathroom is in the back. Upper seats have a better view, and the roof is transparent. During the day it was quite enjoyable.There are reserved seats, and if they are available, will cost you a little extra. We only had reserved seats on one bus. Not having a reservation was not a problem. There are some sections, up and down, where the seats face each other (with a small table in the middle). So if you are a party of 3 or 4, it would be good to reserve these seats. You might want to hedge your bet, and reserve seats opposite of each other. This way you'll play footsies with someone you know, not a stranger. It seems obvious now, but the reserved seats are the ones with BIG numbers on them. Once the bus is loaded, it seems OK to move into those seats, but you don't know if they are going to be reserved for the next leg of your journey. The bus does drop off and pick up along the way, though not necessarily at all stops. Some stops are just breaks to stretch your legs, and last 10 to 20 minutes. You might want to bring an extension cord, or have a long charging cable. Sometimes the power is overhead. Brings snacks and drinks, but not alcohol, as it's not allowed. We asked a couple drivers what would happen if you were caught. The answer varied a bit, but it seems likely you will be kicked off the bus. Where you are asked to leave seems to depend on your attitude. If you need anything during the trip, bring it with you when you go to your seat. You can't access your checked bags en route. Consider bringing ear buds or plugs, and eye shades. My conclusion: It was just too many hours. Man this trip dragged on. I would consider it for shorter trips, in fact I'd like to see more of Memphis. And them maybe take a riverboat to New Orleans, and Megabus back to DFW. Bottom line: Good adventure. No problems. No regrets.

311,MED_66,"I wish there was 0 star. Fact: April 4th, 530pm MegaBus from Columbia, SC to Atlanta. Negative service experience, many passengers been waiting here for more than 5hrs (I finally left at 10pm), been trying to call its customer service (which was just a joke) no specific answer, explanation or solution.I don't know how late the bus finally arrived, but what the passenger got were just two BS emails, one sent on 630pm noticing ""2-3 hr delay""; one sent on April 5th 320am saying ""we will investigate""...what they can do is just compensate the ticket value (oh, they charge seat & service fees when booking, doubt they would return this part)But how about valuable hours of wasting from the passengers and their friends and family been waiting for them? The brand management was a disaster. Gook luck if you choose taking MegaBus."
312,MED_66,"After telling driver to turn the AC down in 58 degree weather, she turned it up! Passengers are doing anything possibly to blocks vents and stay warm as our hands and toes are near frozen!!50-9253-120218-M94R-1130-NOL-ATLPlease find out the name of this driver, further actions need to be taken!!!"
313,MED_66,"I have heard good things about the Megabus until now. People say it is cost effective and comfortable. However my recent experience with the phone support was terrible. The first agent said ""I will be happy to help you"" 6 times during my call. Honestly, drop the script. Listen and speak. He did not help me at all. When I explained that I was running late and that I wanted to know if the bus was too, he said he did not know. He suggested I call back in 1o minutes, which would be after the scheduled departure time. When I called back the next agent informed me that I was calling after the departure time. He also advised me that if the bus was late I would have received an email or text. So it was on time. I abandoned my trip only to receive an email 40 minutes later that the bus was an hour late."
314,MED_66,"Picked up a friend using Mega bus, horrible experience, there is no way to know when a bus will arrive, depart, or anything. Complete lack of communication. The bus is supposed to arrive at 11PM, then I am told it is in Athens at 11PM and will arrive at midnight, it does not arrive to almost 2am. With the technology this day and age, Mega Bus needs to have GPS installed into their buses so that customers have a way to know when they can expect their bus will arrive for boarding and when family and friends know when to expect to picked up love ones. If airports and the greyhound can offer this, why can't mega bus? [Review #524] (3rd Review Of 2018)"
315,MED_66,"Yes here is a company in a service business that generates a substantial portion of its income on unused purchases. Yes they go out of their way to inconvenience their customers so they'll run. Greyhound is the frontrunner in this, but megabus runs a sure second. And by the way don't t ask your bank for a refund for fraudulent purchases as ignorant bully's wont't budge. Fly first,Hitchhike second, rent from enterprise third, and if you're re really desperate, buy a used car from a car dealer on route ""One"". Specifics are not important here, because I relate to many who have been taken by the BUS COMPANIES."
316,MED_66,"The customer service alone warrants 1 star, but the fact I paid $22.50 for a bus scheduled for 11 pm that frequently turns up ONE HOUR LATE is ridiculous. No refunds if course. My friend reported the same thing happened to him. The customer service woman hung up on me after 5 minutes. Said simply she couldn't see what I was seeing and gave up helping me. Now this 19 year old girl gets to arrive in downtown ATL at 1:30 am and misses her ride home. Thanks Megabus!"
317,MED_66,"My daughter and I took the Mega bus to Charlotte, NC from Atlanta. Considering that their CSR aren't worth a crap they rate a 0 the bus driver to Charlotte was awesome. Had a great personality, friendly, on time leaving and early arrival and drive with ease. I had seats 1 and 2 which had great view worth choosing your seats. On the way back the driver wasn't as friendly but was on time. Took forever to board the bus and drove with foot constantly on the brake. Not a comfortable feeling especially the way it was raining. So I made sure my daughter and I had our seat belts on. I would use them again.i have recommended them to those who asked how was my trip. Hopefully next time I book the CSR are in better mood if i have any questions..."
318,MED_66,"Despite the many negative reviews, I decided to purchase a round trip bus ticket from Atlanta, GA to Columbia, SC. My bus reservation was canceled the day of my intended trip, which of course is a huge inconvenience. Even worse, the email cited ""weather concerns"" as the reason, even though the weather is perfectly fine in both areas. I did receive a timely refund, which is why i gave them 2 stars."
319,MED_66,"I rode Megabus from Jacksonville, FL to Atlanta, GA on 6/22/19. We left Jax at 1:50p. The bus left on time, one star. Bus arrived in Atlanta, safe and on-time, second star. That's where the positives ended. I sat on top deck, reserved a seat, hoping to get panoramic views during travel. That was impossible because the the windows were filthy! The bus had plugs available for charging however, the plugs were loose hanging and wobbly; therefore, the cord kept coming out of the plug complicating the charging process. Also, It was 90 degrees and the air conditioner on the bus wasn't working properly. I spoke with the driver about this during our stop in Tifton and he said the top deck was always hot due to the sunroof. He further said the air was turned up as high as it could go. When I placed my hands on the vent, air was barely coming out. Some of the ladies on the top deck starting coming out of their tops stripping down to sports bra due to heat. It was terribly uncomfortable. Finally, we ran into some rain which meant no sunlight on the roof top so the temp improved; but guess what? The rain started to leak into the bus and wet the passengers. I was ready to get off the bus never to return. This was my first experience on a bus ride and it will be my last. I'm very thankful for arriving safely; which is the most important thing. But I guess you get what you pay for. Cheap is just that ""cheap!"" Don't expect much when you pay so little."
320,MED_66,"Awful experience from Atlanta to Nashville. Driver pulled over on the shoulder twice with no commentary on what is wrong. We pulled off on an exit in the middle of nowhere, left a man there, and then sat in Chattanooga waiting for two hours for a new bus. We still have two hours to go before we made it to Nashville. And some folks were still travelling to Chicago. One lady even said she'd miss her interview tomorrow morning in Chicago. Nobody on this bus is happy at all. I will never use Megabus again. Ever."
321,MED_66,"This has to be the worst travel service ever. SAVE YOUR MONEY. Take greyhound take anything but. The bus that showed up wasn't even a megabus. It had no chargers no WiFi. But that wasn't really the worst part. So upon arrival no one informed us we were at our stop naturally you would think they would make an announcement loud enough or I don't know check to see if everyone was off they bus. so we drove 40 minutes pass the stop and 40 minutes back so of course they just throw your bags off the bus on the sidewalk and walk away. so freaking out I ask the driver to please contact the check in person. She informed me she had no contact to anyone with the company or at the check in areas. Wow. So now of course my luggage was not there. No one knows what happened to it. Now to the phone. Every call was I will contact the buses. Why? they threw it off so of course it's not going to be on there. Can't get a refund for this horrible service. No matter what no refunds.This company is just out to get your money. THEY DONT CARE ABOUT YOUR SERVICES. They just want your money. I have no luggage, I'm in a city I don't know with nothing and they want me to write an email. Horrible horrible horrible."
322,MED_66,"First of all no damn outlets worked on the bus trip from Chicago to Atlanta...a9-10 hour ride in a car...14 on the bus. First of all the bus did leave on time and still arrived 2 hours late....then bus was kind of empty and the driver OMG did under the speed limit I'm like dude can you speed up a little. He did charge my phone because his seat was the only one that could charge a phone. However, when we changed drivers in TN somewhere, this is where all hell comes inThe lady bus driver took her time walking over to the bus because she was so busy what was going on on her phone...I'm like ugh damn get off the phone so we can go. She kept the bus so damn cold I'm literally wrapped up like a damn cocoon on the bus....let some ppl off in Chattanooga TN and we asked can we go to the gas station right quick she said yeh. So about 7 of us quickly walk to the station, buy our stuff and it was me and another passenger we pay for our stuff and quickly head back out the door. We make it just past the damn gate and wth the bus driver pulling off... we like whoa whoa...so she stops the bus and yell up to get in on the back of the bus...I'm like really bitch you was gonna leave us...then the lady upstairs was like we told her you wasn't back yet but somehow she didn't hear her....so yeh I had a stank attitude for the remainder of the trip and felt like I was in a meat cooler..you need a damn quilt because small lightweight 1.99 blankets from wal mart don't work.however had the damn outlets worked this review may have gotten 3 stars."
323,MED_66,Worst experience on this bus! It's 95 outside and the air doesn't WORK it's hot as hell!! Why would they let someone drive a bus with no air!!! It stinks!! Bus driver was 2 hours late they told us nothing! If I would of known about this air conditioning situation I wouldn't of took this bus for free. NEVER AGAIN
324,MED_66,"After my experience with greyhound and their late buses, rude staff and poor conditions I am giving megabus 5 stars!!!! Bus arrived early, left on time, staff was polite, patient and helpful. Even the driver was polite to passengers! Only downside is the wifi and the seats you book don't matter, just find an empty seat. I will never be riding with greyhound as long as megabus is still in business!!!!!"
325,MED_66,"They are cheap but you get what you pay for. The wifi barely works, customer service is nearly non-existent! I had a customer service rep hang up on me. Their service sucks. The only reason I am giving them 2 stars is because of the affordability and the few times when I actually experienced mediocre service. It's a love and hate relationship because you don't want to give them your business but they are the cheapest alternative to traveling. Greyhound is way more expensive but the wifi usually works and you actually have somewhere to sit and wait for the bus. Just remember, you get what you pay for and don't expect superior customer service, especially not over the phone!"
326,MED_66,"I recently rode with Megabus from Birmingham to Atlanta on a Thursday trip-- 2:30pm departure and 6:35 arrival. The bus arrived actually ahead of schedule at 6:25, despite a 5 min late departure from Birmingham. For $19 a ticket it is what you would expect-- garbage left on the seats and a little bit crowded, but an easy option for someone not wanting to make the drive into Atlanta traffic."
327,MED_67,"It looks like Peak Performance will be my new home. After getting my body screwed up, I was referred here. When I pulled up to the dilapidated shopping center, it's almost depressing to park and walk through the parking lot. Parking spaces are large and abundant but it's like a ghost town here. Dennis, my physical therapist, gave me a thorough interview to get a good understanding of the status of my injuries. He really took a long time to try and devise a plan to put me on a path or recovery. He wasn't the only concerned guy here. The whole team seemed to be watching out for all the other patients. Others would step in to make sure I was taken care of. Not once did I feel even slightly disregarded. I highly recommend injured souls come here for a professional, efficient treatment with lighthearted physical therapists. They always seem to be in good mood... and that itself is uplifting."
328,MED_67,Went here after rotator cuff surgery. The therapists are the best. Jenna and Tim worked with me for about 8 weeks. Any therapy is difficult but the benefits far out weigh the short time spent in therapy. The care provided was excellent. I've been to a few therapy centers and Peak is by far the best.
329,MED_68,"Dr. Cornell is fantastic!!! She knows exactly how to listen to your needs, and will work with you at your own pace to treat your opportunity. I have been receiving treatments from Dr. Cornell on an as needed basis for about 2 years. She is consistent, reliable, knowledgeable and very good at Dry Needle; to boot she is always helping to find ways to work with you through physical therapy, posture, exercises and so on, so that you can live the daily better, with less pain/pain-free and more healthy. I do not normally write these type of reviews, however, since I tell everyone how great Dr. Cornell performs Dry Needle and simply goes above and beyond, I am compelled to write this AAA+++ review for Dr. Cornell.Give it a try, you will be surprised!"
330,MED_68,"Dr. Cornell is amazing. She has helped me work through many issues caused by my job, weight lifting and recovery from surgery. She is thoughtful and always a pleasure to be around. She is also always learning new techniques and therapies to better serve her patients. I have recommended her to many friends and will continue to do so as she always goes above and beyond!"
331,MED_68,"Had some dry needling with Andrea, she is very professional and probably the most friendly therapist! i have meet and i have seen more then my share."
332,MED_68,"After years of kitchen work, I have been trying to work out shoulder, back, and neck pain to extremely limited success. Not even an hour of dry needling and I haven't felt better, amazing stuff. If you've been experiencing chronic pain or even minor discomfort, go here. You won't regret it."
333,MED_68,"I've been seeing Andrea for hip/back pain. After visiting a few other PT's I was getting frustrated by not seeing any improvements to my pain. I've been to Andrea a few times now and not only is my pain improving, I finally understand what is causing the pain. Andrea has shown me exercises to do at home in addition to the dry needling. She thinks outside the box and I appreciate the time and effort she always puts into each session. I was extremely hesitant about dry needling at first but Andrea was extremely patient with me and made me feel comfortable. I can't recommend Andrea highly enough!!"
334,MED_68,"I saw Andrea for dry needling for leg/hip pain and severe range of motion limitations. After seeking services at MANY other places, Andrea was by far the most knowledgeable and helpful. If you pay for an hour of treatment you will get more than your money's worth. At other offices they may dry needle tentatively and on 3-4 sites with little to no improvement in pain and range of motion. Andrea does as many sites as necessary to see symptom improvement. Cannot recommend highly enough. Relief in first visit and was sent home with exercises. Never felt like she was trying to ""fill her schedule"" and pushing visits. She is warm and amicable and will talk to you, not at you, so you truly understand the issues you are having. If other treatments/therapists have left you with little to no improvement, check her out! You will not be disappointed in her skill or dry needling!"
335,MED_70,I went to Howell Rehab after I had a nearly torn rotator cuff. The main physical therapist I went to was: Drew (short for Andrew--his step-dad owns the Rehab Center). I had weeks of PT to get it back to the shape it was in before my accident. I HIGHLY recommend them! ...and follow every instruction that they give you! You're in good hands!
336,MED_72,"I began three years ago with BErun project which was life changing and resulted in a great group of friends. Since then,each service BEyond exercise has offered has been exceptional. Personal service with innovative techniques focused on being healthy"
337,MED_72,"This has been a fantastic place to get care. I was lucky enough to get an appointment with Eric, the founder, who really dug in to listen to me, and think hard about what was causing my recurrent running injury. If you're looking for sport specific, especially running, injury diagnosis and care--start here. I was wondering if I should go to an academic health center, or start with an orthopedic specialist, but I hoped I'd come to BE and be taken seriously for my issue. I was and I really appreciate the attention and personalized advice. Eric has not pushed for frequent visits or tried to sell me on other services. His professionalism is stellar. As a physician myself, I really appreciated his approach to care."
338,MED_72,"I went to see Eric Schneider for help with a knee injury, IT band syndrome. He has been great with me. He is very nice, respectful, professional, and informative.He has been very good at explaining how to improve my running form."
339,MED_72,"I have worked with the team at Beyond Exercise for more than half a year, and they are top notch experts in assessing and training, helping me return from a knee injury while helping me improve my balance and core to the best of my adult life (I am just over 50). I recommend them highly."
340,MED_72,Eric is a top notch PT and I'm very grateful for his treatment for my achilles tendon rupture. Through his expertise I returned from a serious injury to a fitness level well beyond my capabilities prior to my injury.  His studio has state of the art equipment and his staff are top notch and leaders in their field. This boutique facility offers personal service and exceeds expectations.
341,MED_73,"Amazing care! Everyone here is so courteous with patients. I've been bringing both of my kids to see Dr. William Warren since they were born, he is an amazing pediatrician. Very caring, extremely knowledgeable, and patient and explaining thoroughly to parents.This clinic focuses on low income families and they do an amazing job. Plus the infrastructure of the clinic is wonderful!"
342,MED_75,Dr Cornett really helped me when I thought all was lost and that I would just have to live with the pain. I was a chiropractic skeptic and wouldn't have gone if it weren't for my sister's insistence - she noticed I was limping and was adament that I try a chirpractor. I'm very happy to say that there was noticeable difference immediately after my first adjustment. I like that this center also offers physical therapy and accupuncture.
343,MED_75,"I've had many chiropractors in life, since 1996, and Dr Paul Bowen is the best of them all! He talks to you honestly, like a friend. You know he loves what he does, he's excellent at what he does, and even asks about you - your family, asks how you've been, and is just an all around cool guy. I recommend him to EVERYONE who mentions they're having headaches, back, neck, shoulder, hip pain, etc. The staff is very friendly, and they have many other services available as well (physical therapy, dry needling, and more). Check them out. You won't be sorry!"
344,MED_75,"Dr. Paul Bowen is amazing! He recently came into the office, on short notice, on his day off to help my daughter with her sports injury. He always has just the right technique to alleviate her issues and keep her on the court. I highly recommend Dr. Bowen for his professionalism and commitment to quality of care!"
345,MED_75,I've been to a few chiropractic places and this is by far my favorite. I like that they think of the whole package- meaning asking about you lifestyle and habits to try to find out what is causing your issues. They don't just crack you and send you on your way. If you have an ache or pain they will demonstrate some exercises or stretches that will help. The folks at the front desk are nice and help muddle thru all the insurance mumbo jumbo.
346,MED_75,"I've been going to Mt. Lookout for about a year. I have only ever been seen by Dr. Cornett in this particular office, but he is awesome! Every time I go he is very thorough and asks me about life and any new symptoms or concerns I maybe having. I have referred 3 of my coworkers to him. I can't say enough great things. If I show up in pain, I usually have all if not most of my symptom relief by the time I leave."
347,MED_75,"I have never been to a chiropractor every in my life and I'd never really planned to until I injured my back and even the ER had nothing for me. I put out a request for recommendations in on Facebook and my cousin recommended Mt. Lookout Chiro. I did a little research and called in for an appointment which they were able to give the same day! The staff was very friendly. Unfortunately, I cannot remember the name of the doc that I was seen by but he made sure that I was comfortable and understanding what he would be doing. He checked the X-rays I'd had done in the ER and explained exactly what was going on with my back. He even gave me a pair of shorts to change into so that he could stretch me out better than in my jeans. He adjusted my back and sent me in for some kind of ultrasound therapy on my back which had me walking upright the same day! It was some kind of miracle. He advised that I come back 3 more times that week but after visits and adjustments coupled with recommended exercises I was doing just fine. I will say this place is pretty legit. They have Saturday hours and are easy to schedule with. God forbid I have another crazy injury like that but if I do, I will be returning to Mt. Lookout."
348,MED_75,"Ive been coming to this chiropractor for a few years now. I really like the doctor however when I went in yesterday, I had to wait almost 45 minutes to be seen. I have an appointment at 11am to be ""squeezed in"". When I checked in they said that my doctor didn't have anything going at the moment and it shouldn't be too long. After I checked in, a gentleman checked in who was about 3 hours early for his appointment. For whatever reason, he was seen before me which was quite frustrating. Hopefully this was just a fluke but it was quite frustrating to have to wait forever and then be seen after others who had an appointment later in the day. Ill be continuing to go back here however, mostly because of the doctor."
349,MED_75,"If you need to go to a chiropractor this is the place you should go to! I have been seeing the doctors here for 30 years. They are absolutely the best in town. It's easy to get appointments and there is never a long wait. The staff here is excellent, professional and friendly."
350,MED_75,"Dr. Mark King has the worst bedside manner I've ever seen. I heard him cursing at his staff and found him to be insulting and arrogant. There are better options out there, proceed at your own risk."
351,MED_75,"I highly recommend Dr. Eiselt. I had never been to a chiropractor before and was a bit skeptical. One night I fell down a flight of steps and hurt my shoulder and back. My boss referred me to Dr. Eiselt and I was able to get in the next morning. He has seen me three times so far, and I am doing so much better."
352,MED_75,"I had to find a new chiropractor after mine turned out to be fairly prejudiced, which made appointments pretty awkward. (Personal opinions on things like that have no place in doctors appointments). Anyway, I took a chance and made an appointment with Dr. Placeway. I had been having migraines that would start as a pain under my right shoulder blade and eventually shoot up my neck and into the back of my head, eventually causing a horrible headache that would last for a while. I'm unable to take NSAIDS, so the pain got old fast. My old chiropractor would just adjust me every so often and send me on my way without telling me why I was having these issues. Dr. Placeway and the massage team pinpointed exactly why I was having these issues. After a few visits, I was fixed up and I had advice on how to prevent this in the future. This past week, I started having insane amounts of jaw pain. I thought I was having some sort of dental issue, but an emergency trip to the dentist didn't help anything. He couldn't see anything on the X-rays and suggested I see a root canal specialist (uh what??). I woke up in excruciating pain early Wednesday morning and called the Mount Lookout Chiropractors office. I was unsure of what kind of doctor I even see for jaw pain. Luckily, they're there fairy early. The receptionist was super nice and informed me that they do a lot of work with TMJ (temporomandibular joint dysfunction), which I was pretty sure I had, and was able to get me in later that day. Dr. Placeway told me TMJ is one of his specialties. He checked my jaw, it's movement, the clicking, and listened to the issues I was having with it. He gave me exercises to do (I look dumb, but they're working!) and had me make a couple more appointments for the following weeks to fix me up. I'm honestly relieved. You'd think a dentist would have noticed this earlier and saved me the insane amount of pain, but I'm sooo lucky that I have an awesome chiropractor. The receptionists are super nice and I'm always taken on time with minimal waiting. The massage therapists are really great, too. They're always really helpful."
353,MED_75,"I went today to see Dr. Eric W. Eiselt, D.C. I've never in my life seen a chiropractor but I've had some persistent lower back pain for the last week and had to do something about it. I'm glad I did. After just a few adjustments I felt sooooooooo much better. Go see Dr. E, he's great, super nice and wonderful. He even lets you borrow shorts if you come in from work in a dress :). This place has great hours, good staff and free parking. Couldn't be better. I called the morning of and they got me in within an hour. Can't say enough good things."
354,MED_75,"With my back in such bad shape last fall, I started seeing a new chiropractor (my third, who turned out to be, indeed, a charm!) Dr. Jason Placeway of Mt. Lookout Chiropractic got me to a point where I could at least function, with a tolerable amount of pain. Then he sent me down the hall to physical therapy with Dave. He looks like a drill sergeant, but he's actually quite mild and patient. No-nonsense, though. Over the course of about eight weeks, I spent a few hours there each week, strengthening my badly neglected, flabulous body -- particularly my core to help support my back. I got stronger, had a few chiro adjustments along the way, and ""graduated"" from PT. My back still felt fragile, but still better than since I'd given birth to my son in 2009.Now I go back for occasional chiropractic adjustments with Dr. Placeway. My back is in great shape after years of pain."
355,MED_75,I am a long distance runner & always have a ache here & there! Dr. Steve is great with adjustments & gets me back out on the road!
356,MED_75,"Dr. Eiselt was recommended to me when I was having leg problems while running. I had been to so many doctors by this point that was completely deflated and thought i would need to stop running. I was extremely optimistic after my first visit and finally had some real answers! I'm so happy to have found a chiropractor that is attentive to my needs, personable and helps me feel and live better. I would recommend this group and Dr. Eiselt to anyone in need of chiropractic care."
357,MED_75,"The staff is very friendly and helpful, on the phone and in person. The doctors are compassionate and on time (I rarely had to wait during any of my appointments). and the treatments worked perfectly. So, based on my experience, the 5-star ""as good as it gets"" rating is fully warranted."
358,MED_75,"I would not recommend anyone coming here and seeing Dr. Placeway. He is pretty nice and the ladies will probably think he is good looking, but that is about all you will get out of him. I went in for a sprained ankle and he had me get an MRI done. He didn't even look at the image, instead relying on the report. Then he put me in a boot for 6 weeks and made me come in 1-2 times each week so he could look at my ankle for like 2 minutes and then say I am improving. He hardly gave me any guide when it came to stretching, therapy, or anything else. It was basically come in and waste your time. Eventually he referred me to an Orthopedic and that was a God send. Now I am actually getting physical therapy done and not only did the Orthopedic look at the MRI image, so did the physical therapist. I now feel I have been properly diagnosed, and now 7 months after the injury I can finally rehab it properly. Maybe for back/neck issues he would be good, but don't fall for the sports medicine they claim to treat. Can't speak for the other doctors, but he left a bad taste in my mouth and I will never go back."
359,MED_76,this place is a total dump!!! I would not send my worst enemy here!! there rooms are semi private so chances are you will get stuck with a horrible roommate!! avoid this place at all costs!!
360,MED_76,"My mom was sent here after suffering a brain aneurysm. She was at the Drake rehab located in Christ hospital. While I do think their respiratory therapists where excellent and I do think they did ok monitoring my mom they really didn't do anything else. She was there almost three weeks and not seen once by a doctor, they never consulted with a neurologists to try something to help her get more alert. They were not proactive at all in her care. The insurance company wanted my mother shipped off to a skilled nursing facility and the social worker/case manager NOT ONCE told us how we could appeal that and said there was nothing they could do. The killed nursing facility where my mom went to(for a whole 14 hours before she had to go back to UC) examined my mom and even told the Nurse Practitioner and Case worker at Drake that they had reservations about my mom and didn't think she should go. Again they dropped the ball because these people care more about the insurance companies then the actual patients welfare. They allowed my mom to be transferred to a skill nursing facility, who already said they didnt think could care for her, and they also failed to actually talk to the charge nurse facility before safely discharging her. Isn't there an actual law or requirement that before you discharge someone to another facility you actually have to get a hold of someone at said facility and give full report? They tried calling the fatality once and didn't get a hold of someone so that should of been a red flag to not allow my mom to be discharged yet. If your insurance allows it please choose anywhere but this place. Specialty Select hospital was AMAZING and took excellent care of my mom"
361,MED_76,"I worked here for 3 years and it was horrible. Management was a mess and treated the staff terribly. The nurse and other staff are over worked, overwhelmed and burnet out. I didn't realize how burn out I was until I got another nursing job else where. My advice- don't work here unless you have no other choice and if you do have to work here get your experience then leave"
362,MED_76,"Nice facility. Appalling staff. My mother had lung cancer and was in Drake inpatient hospice care for about a week. She wanted to come home, Drake said they strongly advised against it. When my mother insisted on coming home, and granted she could get very mean at the end, the nurses told her I said I didn't want her to come home. The doctor who talked to my husband, brother and me also told her, in front of us, ""Your children do not want you to come home"", after we had told him we needed to get a hospital bed and potty chair before we could bring her home. I was disgusted by this, and my mother never let that go, believing we did not want her home. She died feeling like a burden because the doctor became exasperated trying to convince her to stay, she (meanly) insisted on going home, and Dr decided to throw us under the bus to convince her to stay."
363,MED_76,"If you are looking for a rehabilitation center and if you ONLY need to be helped with PT this is the place to go, if you have ANY other health issues stay away! Physical therapy is good here, compared to other rehabilitation centers they actually work with patients a lot to help gain strength. However for inpatient care it seems they have a B team of nurses. Overall they are rude and seem annoyed when people put on their call light for help. Every day if you ask a simple question (for example, where can visitors put outside food for patients) you will get a dramatically different response. You will not get timely care. They do not read charts well and certainly do not communicate with your other physicians, from my perspective they pushed options other doctors did not recommend."
364,MED_76,"If you care about a family member who has suffered a devastating stroke or other injury, do not leave them at Drake by themselves. For the most part that staff is lazy, will not change soiled bed clothing, will not suction patients as ordered, most of the staff is cold, heartless and apathetic about giving care. Twice my husband was left in his wet bed for over an hour. After multiple times of asking for someone to change his sheets, I requested a clean set to do it myself. A staff member handed me the sheets and walked off. She didn't offer to help me move him or offer any advice on how to do so. Clean linen is always hard to find at Drake. The place is filthy. One night I left for the evening and came back to find my husband almost drowning in his lung secretions. He hadn't been suctioned all night and he was in respiratory distress. I know they are overworked just like everyone but the shocking lack of care at Drake is close to what you'd expect to see in a third world country instead of a facility ran by UC."
365,MED_77,"Great clinic that puts the patient's needs first! Staff is friendly & knowledgeable; capable of treating musculoskeletal, neuro, orthopedic, vestibular and sport related injuries. They will get YOU on the road to recovery!"
366,MED_77,"I'm amazed in the improvement in my condition since seeing Lisa Kelly and her team. Highly skilled, very knowledgable, observant and really listens to you as a patient. They clearly prioritize the patient needs, and work with you to achieve recovery. An excellent experience."
367,MED_77,"I found what I was in need of with Lisa Kelly and her team. Having experienced other sports oriented physical therapy clinics and DO treatment, and still having neck issues, a friend recommended Lisa and her team. I was pleasantly surprised to receive treatment during my evaluation. Lisa closely observed my body mechanics in the process of my evaluation and treatment. Treatment appointments were scheduled immediately and varied between 3 different associates, each with a slightly different approach. Deep tissue massage, pressure point manipulation, ultra sound and exercise were all utilized. Each appointment provided increased pain relief and increased range of motion. Practical at-home exercises were assigned and I followed through most of the time. Quantifiable measurement of my disability was recorded initially and monitored throughout treatment. I am 3 months post-discharge and feeling like myself again."
368,MED_78,"first things first, the place was spotless!! it had a nice ambiance as well and the staff is great.They take great care of you here, personal attention is absolutely something they value here. they also don't hurt you in the process of trying to get you healthy like most places do.if you ever need therapy, this is the place to go."
369,MED_80,"The staff at PT are very funny and very thorough. It's nice they make sure everyone is completing their physical therapy. They communicate with you on what you are to do and what is expected. This is a great cozy place where the support is fantastic and personable. Thanks Mike, John and Eileen"
370,MED_80,We had a problem communicating at this location on how long I could stay for exercising because of the cost. The owner did call me personally and we worked it out.
371,MED_80,Would give zero. Accused me of not paying my copay up front sent me a bill. When I called I was told I didn't pay thought I paid cash & they said nope no receipt & they keep ALL of their receipts. Asked for the day & found it on my debit card statement THANK GOD I put it on my card & didn't pay cash. When I told the lady I found it on my statement she said oh I will have it removed... Didn't ask for proof of payment or anything. Shady. Make sure you don't get scammed out of money at this place.
372,MED_80,"They truly care about you and your pain and it shows by their personable care. Dry needling, traction & manipulation provided relief to my neck and back pain. The therapists are always pleasant, have positive attitudes and years of experience and knowledge. They are even funny and entertaining at the same time! I definitely would recommend Mike and his staff."
373,MED_81,"Great massage!! I was having issues with my quad due to weight lifting which was leaving my muscles twitch and preventing full range of motion (as I later found out). The massage therapist, Tiffany Conte, was able to get my muscles to release and improve my circulation. the result was no more muscle twitch, more flexibility and a follow up visit scheduled to fix my back!"
374,MED_83,The whole team was great help and am doing so much better dont know whatbi would have done if did not go to them for the help i needed. Staff is friendly and all of them know there stuff .
375,MED_84,"After undergoing physical therapy at Toledo Clinic for my torn rotator cuff the last 4 weeks, I would highly recommend Tol. Clinic to anyone else needing treatment. The ladies at the front desk have fit times in for me according to my work schedule and my therapist Doug, is a good guy who obviously takes pride in his craft. I've improved significantly since starting therapy with Doug."
376,MED_87,"James is a top notch PT. I can't say I have a ton of experience with PT's but I can speak to the fact that James had a great conversation with me about what I wanted to accomplish with my therapy, helped me understand the steps we needed to take to get there, and after just a few weeks I have seen considerable improvement with the back pain I came in with. It's important for me to be mobile and healthy for my toddler and he has greatly improved my ability to run around with him. Definitely would recommend."
377,MED_87,"A friend of mine recommended James after I busted my knee playing tennis, and I can't say enough great things about him. He listens to your concerns, monitors your pain levels, and anticipates what might become an issue before it ever does. I came to him for help recovering from knee surgery, and aside from obvious knee-related exercises, he's been making sure to prescribe exercises and stretches that will prevent my other leg and hips from becoming misaligned by overcompensating for my bum knee. He has a keen awareness of how everything should work together and makes sure to treat your body as a whole, instead of only focusing on your immediate problem areas. You can tell that he is committed to your personal recovery and pays attention to your specific needs, rather than just prescribing some uninspired treatment. I hope I don't have to see a physical therapist again, but if I do - I wouldn't see anyone but James."
378,MED_87,"James is amazing. He has helped me through two joint replacements and various other injuries. He is incredible, very proactive and interactive and the therapy process. He incredibly aware of how your body is performing and not just concerned with the areas he's been prescribed to treat. That's rare in his occupation and is primarily what sets him apart. You'd be rather silly not to work with James. He's simply the best."
379,MED_87,"Honestly, I woke up without pain for the first time in what seems like forever.  I've been to plenty of PT's, massage therapists, chiropractors, yet none of them have done such a thorough and in depth exam/treatment as James. Not only was he able to pin point the exact pain areas and work through the tension, but he was able to offer solutions that I can work on, on my own (apparently I suck with my posture, and mostly everything I do that involves movement haha). I'm hoping with James continued help, I will soon be able to have my consistent back and hip pain resolved!"
380,MED_87,"I began seeing James due to a car accident earlier this year that left me with horrible back pain. After only a few months of sessions 2x a week and at home exercises, I've been pain free for about a month! James has a modern approach to physical therapy, makes our time together enjoyable but ultimately, fixes you."
381,MED_87,"James has been instrumental in teaching me how to strengthen my core and reduce my lower back pain. I have had significant benefit from his physical therapy in terms of my ability to be more active and to improve my functionality and strength. James provides one on one attention, is always on time, reminds me of my home exercises and next appointments and works hard. His attention to detail is awesome and his hours and location are very convenient. Five stars, highly recommended."
382,MED_87,"I have struggled to find a PT specialist that has helped me with my hamstring pain. Most of the shops that I have checked out have helped me in the short term, but none provided me with a long term game plan. That is exactly what Dr. Caginalp did. Not only did he help with my immediate pain, but he now has me on a game plan of stretches, diet, and more. Healthhub is more than just a one stop shop. If you are looking for a Physical Therapist that cares less about your short term pain and more about your long term health, you are looking at the right place. I now recommend Dr. Caginalp to all of my friends and family."
383,MED_87,"If you need help with an injury or pain, or if you just want to bring your body to its full potential, James Caginalp is your best bet. As a Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) based in Chicago, James has studied many treatment modes and is extremely skilled.  His first objective is to get to know the patient and understand the patient's complaints and needs. He then considers different treatment possibilities for that particular person. He is well versed in physiology -- his expertise extends to a wide range of treatments-- And he is a certified specialist in strength and conditioning.James worked patiently with my painful back injury, arthritis, and balance problems. If I was discouraged, he encouraged me. If I couldn't do it, he showed me that I could. After some months, my body got stronger, the pain subsided, and I could walk normally again! I never dreamed that I would recover to this extent. I should add that I am 65+ years old and never exercised till I was over 50. Even knowing that, James continued undeterred with my treatment and has given me the strength and confidence that I needed.James works his miracles at Healthhub Innovations, the new PT practice that he established in 2018. Healthhub Innovations offers skilled PT services that can change your life!"
384,MED_87,"I've seen a fair number of physical therapists for my chronic pain condition. James is one of the best I've worked with. He spends a lot of time with me 1 on 1, he always explains his thinking to me, and we regularly evaluate what my long-term goal is. Highly recommended."
385,MED_87,Came here for about 3 months and knees have seen marked improvement. James is great at what he does. Would recommend!
386,MED_87,"I have been going to James for PT for the last year, and he is excellent. He has very good bedside manner and is also very knowledgeable about the condition, in which I seek treatment. I find that James uses techniques you don't see often in other PT clinics and as a result is able to help people when other PTs have failed. Overall, I highly recommend James if you're struggling with any orthopedic pain and could use support/relief."
387,MED_88,"I came to Core Physical Therapy after visiting another PT place and feeling that my needs weren't met there. At that place, I didn't feel comforted (as I expressed worries over my injury) and I wasn't given treatment since I was told I'd be ok in 2 weeks (but I didn't feel ok, I was in pain).After that experience, I looked for a different PT place. I'm lucky to have found Karli Smith. From the moment I met her, I felt I was in good hands. She has a warm, caring, kind, compassionate, patient, and understanding demeanor, which is exactly what I needed to help soothe my anxiety over my injury and get me back to where I was before my injury. I appreciate the thorough exam that Karli performed on me. She patiently performed it and explained to me my injury and what the recovery time would look like (6-8 weeks). As she did, I saw her strong understanding of the body, which helped assure me that I was under good care.Once I started healing, Karli helped me realize I was getting better (when I couldn't believe that I was) and encouraged me to built up my PT exercises (when I thought I couldn't/shouldn't push things in fear of getting re-injured). Under her guidance and support, I was able to see that I was gaining my range of motion and I could get back to my old routine. She found a nice balance between encouraging me to step away from fear but not pushing me to a point of pain.I highly recommend Karli Smith. While I'm grateful to have finished my therapy with her, I will miss her!"
388,MED_88,"I truly cannot say enough great things about Nick Barin and Core PT! I started at Core PT in January 2018 after I injured my knee. I felt discouraged because I only had a few weeks to improve before a trip I had already planned. I met Nick for an evaluation and he genuinely listened to all of my concerns and helped me feel confident that I would continue to get better. In those first few weeks, Nick helped my knee become stronger and more mobile so that I could make it through my trip. After my trip, I continued to meet with Nick until I made a full recovery. I appreciated that he paid attention to other health issues I had at the time and tailored our PT sessions based on what I needed. At some point after my knee recovered I injured both of my shoulders. I had such an amazing first experience at Core PT I knew I would go back. At the initial evaluation Nick spent time asking me questions, listening to the issues, and figuring out what was wrong with my shoulders. His diagnosis was spot on which demonstrates just how knowledgeable he is. He also spent time explaining to me what was wrong and how we could improve it. After months of exercises, the graston, and some dry needling the pain in my shoulders is gone. At Core PT I think you get a more personalized experience than you do at other PT clinics. Getting to the root of your issue and fixing it is a priority. I also looked forward to and enjoyed my PT sessions because Nick and everyone else was so nice, caring, and fun to talk to. The entire staff is super friendly and helpful. The on-line scheduling is convenient. Ultimately, I am very happy to have found this place!"
389,MED_88,"I just started going to Core but I felt I needed to give my review. After suffering from a wonky knee since at least September, it got so bad I asked my doctor for a PT referral.I originally went to athletico but felt I was not getting proper attention for my therapy. After talking with Jason, he had me come in the next day (thank you for not making me wait!) and we discussed my issues further.  Jason LISTENED to what my concerns were with my knee and the fact that I felt I was getting subpar treatment elsewhere. He brought out a spine and a leg to show me what is happening with my body, gave me his assessment and plan of action. He said that he/they don't just want me to come in and do a bunch of exercises and send me on my way. He assured me that he would spend time with me for my treatment (and then exercises!) and then reassess me to see where we are at and that I am getting proper treatment.I am halfway through treatment and I feel like Core is really taking me seriously. Everyone is awesome. They ask you questions and make sure you are comfortable with each step of the way. They make sure you are doing your exercises correctly and never treat you like a number.I feel that I am being treated like I'm IMPORTANT and that my issues and concerns are important. Everyone seems to really care, they all have fabulous attitudes, and they take pride in getting you better. I enjoy seeing smiling and laughing faces when I am there.Thank you so much for helping me out. I feel like I am getting the best care possible tl:dr - Core is a great place to get your physical therapy. They really work with you and care that you get better."
390,MED_88,"I found this PT practice via great yelp reviews, and I must concur they weren't lying. I worked with Jason for several weeks and saw an 85-90% reduction in pain/improvement of my condition. Can't recommend enough."
391,MED_88,"Jason's assessment was as informative and interesting as it was helpful. He poked around and had me do a couple of movements, and after assessing my pain and movement, explained to me what he suspected was going on. They have photos and skeletons that he was able to use and point out where he thought I was having issues, which very much helped me visualize what I was needing to work on. I LOVE that. It was the first and only time I worked directly with him, as my treatment care was taken over by Kaitlin (who I understand to be at the Lincoln Park location now) and Nick. I had been having pain in my neck and shoulder for just over a year and after seeing a chiro for it first (and finding zero relief), I took to PT. This team is knowledgeable and fun to visit - I looked forward to every appointment I had with them. Nick and Kaitlin were a superpowered team when it came to figuring out the exercises and treatment I needed. I swear, Kaitlin has magic hands. She proposed the idea of dry needling at one of my appointments and I ended up doing a couple of dry needling sessions with her. I am absolutely sold on the fact that those appointments were the turning point for my relief, with the added exercises and strengthening I had to do. I woke up one morning and realized that I was able to turn my head both to the left and right without pain, which was something I hadn't experienced in over a year! I'm so happy that I picked this group to work with. Every person in this office (even the other patients) were nice, friendly, and easy to talk to. Beware though, the office can get VERY chilly in the evening hours once the heat goes off! It sounds so weird, but I almost look forward to my next ailment so that I can start working with these people again. Hands down will be back to work with them if I ever need to!"
392,MED_88,"I am about to complete my post-microdiscestomy recovery this week at Core PT - Loop; and, before all, it is very important to mention that the entire staff at this practice has been top-notch. They're a rare combination of personable, knowledgeable, caring, and motivating.Notably, Jeff Bitter, the DPT I worked with, was absolutely amazing. Amazing is not an over-statement by any means. Jeff was empathetic to my unique circumstance of being a 22-year-old having to deal with chronic-pain-related-symptoms and with a recent spinal surgery. He made sure I was completely aware of the trajectory of my progress, what I should expect, and what my body expected of me to make sure I was maintaining the level of progress I've reached. He's made sure I stayed, and continue to stay, on track in regard to running and returning to normal activity levels.As others have stated when reviewing this practice, there are no miracles involved with being treated here; although, the quality of PTs and support staff is top-notch, the expectation is clear that you must work hard reach your recovery goals, and the support from the positive atmosphere and personable staff radiates and translates well to your recovery."
393,MED_88,"I ran the Boston Marathon in April and did something to something...but I wasn't sure what. I was really frustrated when it didn't go away after 1...then 2...then 3 weeks. One of my coaches recommended Nick at Core Physical Therapy. Everyone was really nice to work with, from my initial consultation appointment all the way to my 12 or so visits. They worked with my insurance to get me additional approved visits when my condition wasn't healing as much as we had hoped, which was super helpful.Everything was very personalized and I really felt like Nick listened to how I was feeling at each visit and would tailor things based on how I was feeling. I am back to running and now training for Chicago - looking forward to coming back stronger and faster thanks to Nick and team at Core!"
394,MED_88,"I've been working with Jason and the staff for several months and it's been great. I acquired a trimalleolar fracture (badly broken ankle) in early September, followed by surgery and R&R. I started with Core in December and have been on the steady road to discovery since. It's been incredibly unremarkable, which is exactly what I wanted. No surprises, no setbacks.The online scheduling is handy. My schedule is often very tight and I almost always find a time to get in with just a couple days notice.Prior to visiting Core, I only heard bad-to-not-good things about physical therapy. My experience has been the opposite. Highly recommended."
395,MED_88,"Nick was great in identifying the causes of my upper back pain. He was genuinely concerned with getting me better and he was able to do it. Thanks to him, Erica (trainer) and Linda (admin)."
396,MED_88,"I was been dealing with back pain for most of my 20's. As I got into my 30's, I started to resign myself to the fact that I just had a bad back, and that was going to be something I'd have to deal with for the rest of my life. My chiropractor recommended Core PT to make sure I was exploring all options for possible treatment.I met with Jason on my first visit. After some Q&A and about 5 minutes of physical evaluation, Jason said, ""You don't have a bad back. I understand what this is, and we're going to fix it."" He then took the time to explain the mechanical problem that was driving my back pain, and we started working on it that day. I saw Jason a 1-2 times per week for a couple months, and made great progress.After taking a break for a few months, I aggravated my back playing golf and went back to Core PT. This time I ended up with Jeff, and over the course of a few weeks, had the same great experience. I'm writing this review now, about a year removed from my last treatment with Jeff. I've continued to work hard on my own, and am now doing much, much better. I can say with absolute confidence, that I would've never figured out how to deal with my back problems myself, without everything I learned from Jason and Jeff about the source of my problems, how to address, etc.I think this speaks volumes about Jason and Jeff's approach to treatment. They worked with me to figure out the problem, helped me understand how to fix it, pushed me really hard during treatment to get me back on the right track, and left me with the tools to continue making progress on my own. They were all about getting me better; not making me into a perpetual patient so I'd just keep coming back for treatment. Would highly recommend to anyone."
397,MED_88,"I came with an injured ankle and Nick was able to accurately diagnose the root cause of the problem, give me some exercises to strengthen the muscles and helped relax the injured tendons."
398,MED_88,"I underwent bunion surgery early this year and my swelling wasn't going down as quickly as I hoped. My doctor prescribed PT and I looked online for a local alternative. I work in the loop and Core Physical Therapy is conveniently located to my office so I could scoot over there in the middle of the day or the way home. They are in a new spot which has ample space now. Jeff, who is extremely personable, gave me my initial assessment and was very efficient in setting a path to recovery. He listened to what my primary physical activities are (yoga, jogging, biking) and customized a program to get me there sooner versus later. Jeff believes in working with the natural mechanics of the body to best insure against any needed surgical intervention in the future. Between hands on massage therapy and targeted exercises, within 4 weeks I was able to start back to my routines. Jeff and his staff are extremely knowledgeable and friendly to work with. I would highly recommend you check this group out for any ailment you need treated. (Linda was also on top of helping with the insurance admin.)"
399,MED_88,"Jason changed my life. A big statement, for sure, but a true one. I had been suffering from constant pain in my left hip and leg, and decided to finally get some physical therapy. My coworker referred me to Core, and from day 1 I knew I was in good hands with Jason. His professional, calm demeanor immediately puts you at ease, and his expertise with the human body gives you confidence in his treatment. After some weeks of therapy, I was pain-free for the first time in months, and the pain has remained under control for months following my therapy. A small miracle, in my opinion.Following my therapy on my leg and hip, I was involved in a motorcycle accident (not my fault, I swear) and suffered a shoulder injury. I was so confident in Jason's abilities that I immediately returned to Jason for treatment, which has also been very helpful.It's a relief to have a therapist you can rely on when your body fails on you, and I'm thankful for that. When you add in a convenient location, easy online scheduling with tons of openings, and a staff you know by name, it's a no-brainer - go to Core."
400,MED_88,"Jason Kart was hugely helpful and informative when I injured my knee when running. I love being active, so going to Physical Therapy and taking a break from my normal exercise routine wasn't ideal.Going to Core Physical Therapy was a huge eye-opener. I learned a lot about how my body composition impacts how certain joints like my knee function. Jason was great at explaining not only how to correct the issue, but also what it was and what caused it in the first place.My visits with Jason included some sports massaging and a series of exercises. Jason equipped me with several exercises to do on my own, as well as referred me to a podiatrist to help my knee even more. I am proud that after a few short weeks, I am happily running again pain-free!Core Physical Therapy isn't just a ""band aid"" for your pain, it's a real solution. I could not recommend this clinic more highly!"
401,MED_88,"I was having problems with my achilles tendons and my knees. I was struggling just to walk and had even bought a cane and was taking Aleve almost every day. I wanted to try physical therapy to see if it could help. So I went to Core Physical Therapy in the loop to get an evaluation. After I spoke with Jeff Bitter one of the therapist there, I gained insight as to what was probably causing my difficulties and what kind of techniques and exercises would be best for me. I was able to start that very same week. Making appointments are easy and the schedule is very flexible. I was able to do sessions during my lunch break twice a week. The staff there are very friendly and knowledgeable. They really motivate you as you're going through the exercises. I did an eight week course of therapy which seems nothing compare to the eight months of pain I'd been dealing with that had made me drop out of playing badminton and going to the gym. I've not had to use any medication for my knees or ankles in over a month. My balance is much improved helping me feel more aligned when I walk. I am more aware of the muscle movements needed in walking and the key corrections Jeff showed me, have made me feel less like an invalid.I highly recommend Core Physical Therapy to anyone needing help getting their mobility back."
402,MED_88,"I cannot say enough amazing things about Core Physical Therapy. I saw Nick Barin a couple times a week for over a month for knee pain. He was patient, understanding, and really took the time to listen and care about what aggravated the pain and my goals for treatment. He helped me get over my initial hesitations about how challenging certain exercises were, and was there to answer any questions. Xavier and Erica are fantastic trainers, and are similarly patient and friendly. Linda was also very helpful with insurance and billing questions. I'd highly recommend this clinic, and Nick in particular!"
403,MED_88,"Jason did such a great job keeping me calm about my injury and clearly explaining the steps that we were taking on a weekly basis to rehabilitate me. His assistants, Jeff and Xavier, were also great to work with every session and provided great exercises to strengthen my knee.Additionally, the space is great, as is the scheduling and availability. They were always very accommodating in letting me come in during the evening to be the least disruptive to my work schedule.I went in expecting to need surgery, but having gone through about 10 weeks with Jason and his staff I don't think I'll need it. Thanks so much guys"
404,MED_88,"Went into see Jason on the recommendation of my doctor, Dr. Sara Brown. I'd been in to see her after a few months of PT with another company produced no real progress and it turned out that they'd missed a diagnosis of a torn meniscus in my left knee. Have since been in for two spells of PT, each of which has left me very satisfied with the overall quality of care. Jason and his partner Jeff are very thorough, patient, friendly, and overall nice guys. They do a great job of explaining their diagnosis, how your body works, and overall mechanics of your problem. Instead of treating the symptoms, they focus on understanding why you got hurt in the first place and work to remedying that so it doesn't happen again. I'd recommend them to anyone in need of physical therapy!"
405,MED_88,"Iv being using Jason from core physical therapy for the past two months since I had a meniscus repair surgery on my left knee, every interaction with Jason was extremely professional and friendly, I got to his clinic and I was barely even able to bend my knee and walk and now I can run, squat and do deadlifts with weights! I would definitely recommend Jason to any patient that needs rehab and physical therapy. He is absolutely fantastic and really care about your physical progress Thanks Jason"
406,MED_88,"Had 6 sessions with Dr. Kart and he was able to clearly identify what a majority of my issues were. Just to be clear, 4 sessions in (about two weeks) things hadn't changed. On our 5th session - he made a simple suggestion (adding in an extra sole in one of my shoes) to test a hypothesis of his, and lo and behold, I started feeling much better - not 100%, but better than anyone else I had seen had done.I think I can speak to Dr. Kart's character - his ability to problem solve, and to know what he can and can't do. I get the sense that he is truly dedicated to fixing problems - even if it's not directly related to his own skill set (case in point - referring me to another podiatrist in house to get fitted for orthotics).We'll see if this fixes everything, but even if it doesn't, it's helped immensely already."
407,MED_90,"I am so glad I decided to go to West Town Physical Therapy for recovery from a patellar dislocation and MPFL injury. I (barely) walked in for my first appointment extremely unsure of the road ahead of me, and Rachel proved to be a very integral part in my return to activity. She was always happy to provide her professional guidance any time I had any questions or concerns and was always very attentive to any feedback I would provide prior to each session. She would regularly take any feedback and incorporate it into my sessions which really helped zero in on any issues I had along the way as a result of my injury. Over the duration of five and a half months, her personalized program, which was very specific to my needs, helped me go from being locked in a full leg brace with very limited range of motion, regain strength and balance, transition into plyometrics, and prepare me to meet my goal of returning to my lifelong passions of cycling and snowboarding. I always looked forward to my sessions in the fun and encouraging environment and learned so much that I would have never figured out otherwise. I will always recommend West Town Physical Therapy to anyone."
408,MED_90,"After minor knee surgery, I was lucky enough to work with the team at West Town PT. They were knowledgeable about how far to push me and encouraged me to develop the strength in the foundational muscle groups. Sessions start with a stretching/massage and then we work through a series of exercises, that increase in difficulty over time."
409,MED_90,"Erin was great to work with. Within a few minutes of running some tests, she was able to diagnose why I was feeling pain in certain areas and came up with a combination of exercises that would help strengthen my weak points. She was creative in the exercises chosen as I had never done many of them before and had been to a few other PT's around town. Highly recommended!"
410,MED_90,"I recommend you avoid injuries! But sometimes sh*t happens and then you have to deal with it. So on that note... I highly recommend West Town Physical Therapy after sh*t happens! Great crew, great equipment, great location."
411,MED_90,"West Town PT was great in getting me back to playing basketball confidently. The first couple visits consisted of evaluation, establishing baselines, stretching, and setting goals/expectations. Stephanie was a great communicator and with her routine, I was feeling much better within the first couple weeks. She provided me a list of home exercises which I was committed to. I also had the opportunity to work with Erin who provided some additional insight to the exercises. Overall, my experience was above average compared to other PT I have done. Will definitely come back if needed, hopefully that's not the case."
412,MED_90,"Let me take you back in time. The month was May 2018. I had been neglecting my body for months as pain creeped down from my lower back all the way down into my ankle. I know what you are thinking...your ankle isn't attached to your back! That's what I thought too but that's when I was 33 and I didn't have the knowledge I have now at 34. It's all connected. I had gotten to a point where a combination of chiropractic adjustments and massage was the only thing keeping me from screaming out loud constantly. After giving them a sizable portion of my monthly earnings they deemed me beyond repair. I asked, ""Well what are my options then?"" They told me that I'd either have to go under the knife or one other last non-surgical option called ""Physical Therapy."" I've been deathly afraid of knives since an incident with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in elementary school but that's a different story so I gravitated towards PT. Anyway, I asked for a recommendation and they had only one. It was West Town Physical Therapy. They said, ""If anyone can straighten you out, Erin Conroy can."" I laughed then because I literally did need someone to straighten me out and also because it was better than crying. After reaching out I was able to get an initial appointment within just a couple days. I was still a bit skeptical as I walked but she quickly put me at ease. She told me I'd be able to get back to helping Dr. Frankenstein in just a few weeks. I assumed this was because I was hunched over like Igor. It was a good joke but my back was no laughing matter! I let is slide because she seemed very confident in her ability to fix me up. They say confidence is key and I'm inclined to agree. She was quickly able to diagnose the issue and was hands on in teaching me the exercises I would need to overcome the pain. Since I wasn't in the best shape due to my temporary deformity, I was getting thirsty quick. The cucumber and lemon water prepared by Shelby was also imperative to my success. Hydration is very important I learned from them both. This wasn't related to my back but is key advice. While it didn't happen overnight, the pain began to recede and we were able to continually adjust the exercises to make even more progress. Fast forward a few weeks...I was dancing in a wedding where I received many compliments. I knew we were on the right track. Fast forward a few months..I haven't had pain for quite some time and am happy to report that I am considering taking my dream of learning Jazz tap to reality. None of this would be possible without the West Town Physical Therapy team! Thank you again! While I took some liberties for dramatic effect this story is mostly true and I whole heartily recommend Erin and team."
413,MED_90,Been meaning to write a review for this place for a while! I initially came in her for lower back pain. I didn't just want to get a massage and my doctor really did not help at all so I figured why not give these guys a try. I came in here about half a dozen times where we went through a regimen for me to help stretch my back and a routine to do at home. I know every time even feel my back starting to hurt - I just practice the exercises this team taught me and I am all good. Really learned that stretching is just as important as working out! The location is also super clean and the staff is super nice. Everything really modern and if I ever have any physical therapy needs in the future - I'll be coming here for sure!Also make sure you get a referral from your doctor and then they just take care of everything else. Most plans cover this and you end up having to pay roughly 20 dollars. Not a bad deal!
414,MED_90,"Sarah and her team are nothing short of fantastic. I've been working with them for over a month now, and the amount of personal attention, encouragement and 1-on-1 interactions is incredible compared to other/larger PT offices I've heard of. Her, Erin and Thomas really listen to your feedback and input, and adjust your workouts so you're not over- or under-working the affected areas. My ankle has made vast improvements in mobility and strength since seeing them--and they're extremely friendly and personable to boot! So glad I went with a small business like this one instead of one of the big cookie-cutter chains. Never thought I'd be sad at the idea of completing my PT. Great experience overall!"
415,MED_90,"I recently finished four months of PT with Sarah after a bike accident required a shoulder surgery and the experience was fantastic. I was told by my surgeon that I wouldn't be riding my bike or skiing by the end of the year and after Sarah's work, I was able to get start riding again much sooner. She's professional, incredibly knowledgable and makes you feel a combination of pride for the work you're doing while being pushed to do more. She gives you a good deal of personal attention and you really feel like she's helping you work through your recovery, and not just another client in her book. I would highly recommend Sarah for anyone looking for physical therapy in Chicago, and would rate her and her studio higher than 5 stars if that were possible."
416,MED_90,Sarah is as good as they come for Physical Therapists and people in general. She's so knowledgable about PT and always on the edge of the newest techniques and therapies. I was seeing her for neck/trap chronic pain and her exercises and therapies help tremendously. The clinic is brand new with lots of natural light and she has great prices compared to other bigger companies. I always look forward to my visits. Can't recommend her enough.
417,MED_90,"So happy with my experience at West Town, they were able to fit me in on short notice after an injury. Very professional and knowledgeable!"
418,MED_90,"Fantastic place! I've been going here since April for a bad shoulder dislocation that eventually needed surgery.  Sarah, Sheri and Erin are all wonderful to work with, and a huge shout out to Thomas as well! I can honestly say that I look forward to going to PT!"
419,MED_90,Highly recommended. Sarah is extremely knowledgeable and the results of her program were great. The office is very modern and bright and has all of the latest equipment.
420,MED_90,"I recently moved to the city and needed to find a physical therapy location to help recover from hip surgery. There were plenty of options (mainly larger chain brands like Athletico or ATI) but I came across West Town Physical Therapy and decided to give it a try. I am very pleased with my decision. Sarah and her team are simply great. They are all very knowledgeable and helped me recover from hip surgery with ease. You can tell Sarah and her team truly care about their patients through the effort and attention to detail they put into each session. They knew when to push me and when to hold me back, and because of their expertise I returned to my active lifestyle much sooner than expected. I highly recomment West Town Physical Therapy."
421,MED_90,"Sarah treated me for a knee injury that was keeping me from my usual running routine. After a few months of PT I am now comfortably back running, close to my former distances. While Sarah clearly knows her stuff as a physical therapist, I also really appreciated that she is excellent listener and communicator. She asked the right questions to quickly home in on my problem and was able to strengthen and push me in our sessions without causing additional pain (sometimes I actually felt like I got a pretty good workout!). And she gave me honest and straightforward answers to my questions, with some useful advice on how to avoid injury in the future. While I obviously hope to stay injury-free, I'd definitely see Sarah again for PT. Highly recommended!"
422,MED_90,"I started working with Sarah about six months ago when an old knee injury flared up and made it difficult for me to be active. I immediately knew Sarah was going to be a good fit for me because she was so friendly, professional, and knowledgable! We talked through the movements that reduced or aggravated my pain and she tested the strength of my joints to see where I was particularly weak. Based on these sessions, Sarah created a personalized but diverse fitness plan for me that ended up dramatically reducing my pain and strengthening the muscles that would help prevent future injury. We recently completed our last session and I was genuinely sad to be ending my time working out with her! I'd highly recommend her to anyone who even thinks that PT might help them - she will!"
423,MED_90,"Sarah is awesome! I started seeing her in the beginning of February after my spondylolythesis started troubling me again. I have been to several PTs before who were unable to help with my lower back pain, so I didn't have much confidence going in. When I started seeing Sarah I could barely move without an intense amount of pain in my low back and wrapping around my hip. We started off slowly with stretching and muscle stim because she was concerned about flaring up the injury. She shared that her goal was for me to strengthen the areas that supported my low back, so we continued treatment with core strengthening exercises, stretches, and muscle stim. After a couple months I started noticing an improvement in my mobility, strength, and flexibility. My Pilates instructor even commented that she saw a remarkable difference in my strength since starting PT. As I continued getting stronger Sarah challenged me to take on harder exercises. I am happy to report that I am feeling stronger than ever before thanks to my time at West Town Physical Therapy. So good, in fact, that my insurance company cut me off from any further treatment due to the vast improvement. If you are looking for a warm, friendly, trustworthy, dependable, and professional PT, Sarah is your girl! Thank you, thank you, thank you for getting me strong in time for my wedding."
424,MED_91,"We have a child who has received services at BDI Playhouse (speech, OT and PT) for about a year and a half now. I would highly recommend BDI playhouse to other families. First of all, we have absolutely LOVED each of the therapists we have worked with. They clearly care about our child's progress and are always willing to answer my questions and provide ideas or suggestions as needed. I also appreciate that they will communicate amongst themselves to discuss my son's goals and to make sure we're looking at the big picture. He has made tremendous progress during his time at BDI. They are also excellent at helping me navigate other options to explore.One of BDI's biggest strengths is that their office staff is as wonderful as their therapists. We recently went through a frustrating insurance issue where we needed to obtain approval for additional PT sessions. Insurance was (surprise surprise) slow to address the matter but the wonderful team at BDI did a ton of work on their end to get the approval for additional sessions. They even held my son's spot for weeks and weeks to ensure that he could be seen again as soon as the matter was resolved. I really appreciate how they helped me navigate this problem. I also want to touch on the fact that BDI offers some unique services. They do bike riding lessons, offer some aquatic therapy, feeding therapy, and they have several classes you can sign your child up for to help further their progress. They also offer a monthly gait clinic and will help you obtain orthotics as needed. Finally, their new facility is awesome, super clean and has a nice large waiting room. We have several options for therapy that our closer to us, but we are happy to be working with BDI!"
425,MED_91,"My son was diagnosed with SPD and has been coming to BDI since he was two. He is now 8 and the improvements we have seen are amazing. I couldn't have done this alone. I am grateful for the patience, kindness and the knowledge the therapists have shared with my child."
426,MED_91,My 2 year old daughter has been seeing a speech pathologist here. I am so pleased with her progress and this is down to her therapist. I'm so glad she comes here.
427,MED_91,BDI children's therapy has made a huge difference in my grandsons development. He was a preemie yet just a little over 2 pounds and now as a eighth grader he is on the honor roll.
428,MED_91,"Comprehensive team approach to children""s therapy. The therapists all work together to encourage the greatest outcomes in treatment. You don't have to run all over to find the best therapist. There is so much experience under one roof."
429,MED_91,"BDI offers an amazing staff and a great experience for its clients. My son looks forward to working with his occupational therapist, Terri, each week. I have really been impressed with the progress my son has made with his sensory issues in the past year and I know BDI has played a very important role in that progress."
430,MED_91,"We were introduced to Sheri Berk, the Director and PT at the Naperville BDI location, when our son was first enrolled in EI for benign central hypotonia. At that time, he was 11 months old. He is now 4 years old , and much of his progress is due to Sheri. She has a wonderful way with children, able to engage them, even during those ""plateau phases"" when they are resistant and evasive. Her many years of experience are paired with a great enthusiasm and thirst for learning and sharing new ideas. She comes back from seminars and conferences, excited to share, and her energy is contagious. When we first entered EI, our family was unfamiliar with the intricacies of the system. Sheri was, and has been, our son's Biggest Advocate. I never hesitate to ask her questions or her opinion. She has, on more than one occasion, spoken up and out on behalf of his best interest and treated Luke like her own - not to mention his two sisters, who often accompany him to his therapy times. They are excited as Luke to see ""Mrs. Berk"" and have learned how to ""help"" and encourage their brother through her. The physical space of the Playhouse is HUGE, clean, has every piece of equipment imaginable, is inviting to children with bright colors and like an enormous playhouse, as its name implies. Unlike many other clinics, the therapists are easily accessible, flexible with times and schedules - and Sheri has even met us at other venues like parks and the DuPage Children's Museum. Personally, Sheri has been both an encouragement and example to me and my husband. She has four children of her own - so you know and feel like she totally understands the demands of family life. Her passion for children is so evident and the clear fact that she loves what she does have helped us through those discouraging times. We would recommend Sheri and BDI Playhouse without reservation and are blessed to have met her so early on. I would encourage you to check BDI out and see for yourself. My husband put it best one day after I came back from a session, telling him about Luke and Sheri's interaction with him. He said, almost wistfully, ""Everyone needs a Sheri in their life."" I would agree."

436,MED_92,"BDI offers an amazing staff and a great experience for its clients. My son looks forward to working with his occupational therapist, Terri, each week. I have really been impressed with the progress my son has made with his sensory issues in the past year and I know BDI has played a very important role in that progress."
437,MED_92,"We were introduced to Sheri Berk, the Director and PT at the Naperville BDI location, when our son was first enrolled in EI for benign central hypotonia. At that time, he was 11 months old. He is now 4 years old , and much of his progress is due to Sheri. She has a wonderful way with children, able to engage them, even during those ""plateau phases"" when they are resistant and evasive. Her many years of experience are paired with a great enthusiasm and thirst for learning and sharing new ideas. She comes back from seminars and conferences, excited to share, and her energy is contagious. When we first entered EI, our family was unfamiliar with the intricacies of the system. Sheri was, and has been, our son's Biggest Advocate. I never hesitate to ask her questions or her opinion. She has, on more than one occasion, spoken up and out on behalf of his best interest and treated Luke like her own - not to mention his two sisters, who often accompany him to his therapy times. They are excited as Luke to see ""Mrs. Berk"" and have learned how to ""help"" and encourage their brother through her. The physical space of the Playhouse is HUGE, clean, has every piece of equipment imaginable, is inviting to children with bright colors and like an enormous playhouse, as its name implies. Unlike many other clinics, the therapists are easily accessible, flexible with times and schedules - and Sheri has even met us at other venues like parks and the DuPage Children's Museum. Personally, Sheri has been both an encouragement and example to me and my husband. She has four children of her own - so you know and feel like she totally understands the demands of family life. Her passion for children is so evident and the clear fact that she loves what she does have helped us through those discouraging times. We would recommend Sheri and BDI Playhouse without reservation and are blessed to have met her so early on. I would encourage you to check BDI out and see for yourself. My husband put it best one day after I came back from a session, telling him about Luke and Sheri's interaction with him. He said, almost wistfully, ""Everyone needs a Sheri in their life."" I would agree."
438,MED_93,"We have a child who has received services at BDI Playhouse (speech, OT and PT) for about a year and a half now. I would highly recommend BDI playhouse to other families. First of all, we have absolutely LOVED each of the therapists we have worked with. They clearly care about our child's progress and are always willing to answer my questions and provide ideas or suggestions as needed. I also appreciate that they will communicate amongst themselves to discuss my son's goals and to make sure we're looking at the big picture. He has made tremendous progress during his time at BDI. They are also excellent at helping me navigate other options to explore.One of BDI's biggest strengths is that their office staff is as wonderful as their therapists. We recently went through a frustrating insurance issue where we needed to obtain approval for additional PT sessions. Insurance was (surprise surprise) slow to address the matter but the wonderful team at BDI did a ton of work on their end to get the approval for additional sessions. They even held my son's spot for weeks and weeks to ensure that he could be seen again as soon as the matter was resolved. I really appreciate how they helped me navigate this problem. I also want to touch on the fact that BDI offers some unique services. They do bike riding lessons, offer some aquatic therapy, feeding therapy, and they have several classes you can sign your child up for to help further their progress. They also offer a monthly gait clinic and will help you obtain orthotics as needed. Finally, their new facility is awesome, super clean and has a nice large waiting room. We have several options for therapy that our closer to us, but we are happy to be working with BDI!"

They are also excellent at helping me navigate other options to explore.One of BDI's biggest strengths is that their office staff is as wonderful as their therapists. We recently went through a frustrating insurance issue where we needed to obtain approval for additional PT sessions. Insurance was (surprise surprise) slow to address the matter but the wonderful team at BDI did a ton of work on their end to get the approval for additional sessions. They even held my son's spot for weeks and weeks to ensure that he could be seen again as soon as the matter was resolved. I really appreciate how they helped me navigate this problem. I also want to touch on the fact that BDI offers some unique services. They do bike riding lessons, offer some aquatic therapy, feeding therapy, and they have several classes you can sign your child up for to help further their progress. They also offer a monthly gait clinic and will help you obtain orthotics as needed. Finally, their new facility is awesome, super clean and has a nice large waiting room. We have several options for therapy that our closer to us, but we are happy to be working with BDI!"
481,MED_99,"My son was diagnosed with SPD and has been coming to BDI since he was two. He is now 8 and the improvements we have seen are amazing. I couldn't have done this alone. I am grateful for the patience, kindness and the knowledge the therapists have shared with my child."
482,MED_99,My 2 year old daughter has been seeing a speech pathologist here. I am so pleased with her progress and this is down to her therapist. I'm so glad she comes here.
483,MED_99,BDI children's therapy has made a huge difference in my grandsons development. He was a preemie yet just a little over 2 pounds and now as a eighth grader he is on the honor roll.
484,MED_99,"Comprehensive team approach to children""s therapy. The therapists all work together to encourage the greatest outcomes in treatment. You don't have to run all over to find the best therapist. There is so much experience under one roof."
485,MED_99,"BDI offers an amazing staff and a great experience for its clients. My son looks forward to working with his occupational therapist, Terri, each week. I have really been impressed with the progress my son has made with his sensory issues in the past year and I know BDI has played a very important role in that progress."
486,MED_99,"We were introduced to Sheri Berk, the Director and PT at the Naperville BDI location, when our son was first enrolled in EI for benign central hypotonia. At that time, he was 11 months old. He is now 4 years old , and much of his progress is due to Sheri. She has a wonderful way with children, able to engage them, even during those ""plateau phases"" when they are resistant and evasive. Her many years of experience are paired with a great enthusiasm and thirst for learning and sharing new ideas. She comes back from seminars and conferences, excited to share, and her energy is contagious. When we first entered EI, our family was unfamiliar with the intricacies of the system. Sheri was, and has been, our son's Biggest Advocate. I never hesitate to ask her questions or her opinion. She has, on more than one occasion, spoken up and out on behalf of his best interest and treated Luke like her own - not to mention his two sisters, who often accompany him to his therapy times. They are excited as Luke to see ""Mrs. Berk"" and have learned how to ""help"" and encourage their brother through her. The physical space of the Playhouse is HUGE, clean, has every piece of equipment imaginable, is inviting to children with bright colors and like an enormous playhouse, as its name implies. Unlike many other clinics, the therapists are easily accessible, flexible with times and schedules - and Sheri has even met us at other venues like parks and the DuPage Children's Museum. Personally, Sheri has been both an encouragement and example to me and my husband. She has four children of her own - so you know and feel like she totally understands the demands of family life. Her passion for children is so evident and the clear fact that she loves what she does have helped us through those discouraging times. We would recommend Sheri and BDI Playhouse without reservation and are blessed to have met her so early on. I would encourage you to check BDI out and see for yourself. My husband put it best one day after I came back from a session, telling him about Luke and Sheri's interaction with him. He said, almost wistfully, ""Everyone needs a Sheri in their life."" I would agree."
